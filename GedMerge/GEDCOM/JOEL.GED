2 CONC f Maelgwn Gwyneed came with at least 8 sons and maybe up to 12 and one gr

2 CONC lace where Cunedda's own name is found is in Allt Cunedda near Cydweli, c
2 CONC onsidered amoung the found-fathers of the Welsh Nation. Cunedda's famil
2 CONC y had been important in Scotland for generations. His fathers name was Ed
2 CONC ern, His grandfather was Padarn Peisrudd and his great grandfather Tegid
2 CONC . Cunedda gave his sons Latin names. Called Gwledig, or Over-King, the pe
2 CONC rpetuator of the command and authority of the Dux Britanniarum. He was th
2 CONC e first native ruler of the Cymry after the retirement of the Romans in 4
2 CONC 10. His power extended from Carlisle to Wearmouth, his court being held a
2 CONC t the former place. His retinue consisted of 900 horses, and he wore th
2 CONC e golden belt and other insignia of the office of Over-King. He was a fer
2 CONC vent Catholic and converted his subjects to Christianity; his descendant
2 CONC s were, many of them, ecclesiastics, who organised the Church in his King
2 CONC dom. Cunedda Wledig (or Cunedag) hailed from Manau Gododdin, a sub-divisi
2 CONC on of the greater Kingdom of Gododdin (Lothian) in modern Scotland. His c
2 CONC apital may have been in the Clackmannan region.  His father, grandfathe
2 CONC r and great grandfather bore Roman names and were probably confederate al
2 CONC lies of the Roman Administration living just north of Hadrian's Wall.  Th
2 CONC e appendage to Paternus' name is particularly telling. Like many prominen

2 CONC mself King of Upper Britain. It is likely he was a Pict.  But it must b
2 CONC e remembered that up there, between the Walls, a Pict might be either a
2 CONC n Ivernian, or a Goidel, or a Brython, so far as race went.  It only mean
2 CONC t that he belonged to the free tribes from beyond the Northern Wall, som
2 CONC e of which still practised tattooing. The old province between the Wall
2 CONC s had become alive with little states, homes of raiders and killers.  Th
2 CONC e Picts of Galloway had marked themselves off from the rest.  The Picts o
2 CONC f Manau of the Gododin (meaning the Southern Shore of the Forth) were lea
2 CONC ders of hordes from the wilderness behind them.  The sea rovers had forti
2 CONC fied the island of Inchkeith in the Forth.  Whichever way the Latin looke
2 CONC d, with his face turned north or west from the watchtowers of Carlisle, t
2 CONC here the gleam of weapons flashed across the land by day, and the glare o
2 CONC f burnings reddened the clouds of night. There is small doubt but that i
2 CONC t was out of the gleam and the glare that Cunedda came to the throne as k
2 CONC ing, seizing the office of the old Duke of Britain.  The greater the dang
2 CONC er is, the greater the joy of shattering it.  The more terrible the threa
2 CONC tening of fate, the sweeter the pleasure of defeating it.  It was by mast
2 CONC ering all the ferocious hordes of the invaders that Cunedda could captur
2 CONC e and keep the power.  Doubtless he was come of the blood of their own an
2 CONC cient kings, either Brython or Goidel, but he seized the Roman office too
2 CONC , and thereby stepped into the history of the world. He lived in the sam
2 CONC e time with that of Vortigern of Projecting Lips, who was driven from hi
2 CONC s throne in the south.  But while the one was losing his throne, the othe
2 CONC r was settling himself so firmly in the land that his blood was never t
2 CONC o be extinguished in it again. Thus, Cunedda seized the office of Dux Br
2 CONC itanniarum, or Duke of Britain. Thus he kept it, having his royal court a
2 CONC t Carlisle on the Southern Wall, and his sons keeping his frontiers.ll th
2 CONC e old splendour of the Ruler of Britain was seen again. He wore the golde
2 CONC n belt of the office, and had the old plume of feathers carried before hi
2 CONC m when he walked.  The old retinue of nine hundred horse went with him wh
2 CONC en he rode, and the old red golden dragon was borne above him when he wen
2 CONC t to war, as the silver dragon went with the Count of Britain in the Sout
2 CONC h.  And when you see the Red Dragon Rampant, on a green ground, remembe
2 CONC r that an ancient poem, written a century after Cunedda's death, speaks o
2 CONC f the green standard of his descendants.  Cunedda, then, was the second o
2 CONC f the flame-bearers. Excerts from 'Land Of My Fathers' by Gwynfor Evan
2 CONC s It may have been because of the danger that the Irish might take ove
2 CONC r the country that Cunedda moved down around 300-400 AD from Manaw Gododd
2 CONC in, near Stirling in Scotland; perhaps indeed he was directed to Wales fo
2 CONC r this purpose as one of the Dukes of Britain.  Cunedda and his army prob
2 CONC ably came by sea, for it was very difficult to travel through Lancashir
2 CONC e with its bogs, forests and large rivers.  According to the history give
2 CONC n by Nennius, it was the coming of Cunedda with his eight sons and grands
2 CONC on at the turn of the fourth century which was the most important event i
2 CONC n the formation of Wales since the first century.  Assuming that Nenniu
2 CONC s was correct, it is the memory of the sons-including Ceredig and Edern
2 CONC , and the grandson Meirion-which still lives in the names of districts; b
2 CONC ut the only place where Cunedda's own name is found is in Allt Cunedda ne
2 CONC ar Cydweli.  The family of Gwynedd, the principal royal line of Wales, cl
2 CONC aimed descent from Cunedda through Maelgwn Gwynedd, his great grandson, d
2 CONC own to Prince Dafydd who was executed in Shrewsbury in 1283 - a pedigre
2 CONC e of more than seven centuries.  It is Cunedda Wledig, a Brython of Picti
2 CONC sh descent, who came to Wales from Scotland, who is mainly responsible fo
2 CONC r the Welshness of Wales.  His family had been important in Scotland fo
2 CONC r generations: his father's name was Edern, his grandfather was Padarn Pe
2 CONC isrudd, and his great-grandfather Tegid.  The Latin forms of the names-Et
2 CONC ernus, Paternus, Tacitus - suggest Roman associations, and this is made c
2 CONC learer by the word Peisrudd in the grandfather's name, the pais rudd or r
2 CONC ed cloak showing Roman office. Cunedda gave his sons Latin names.  It i
2 CONC s possible that he was called upon to defend Wales by Mascen or by the ab
2 CONC le Roman general Stilicho, was was reorganising the defence of England ab
2 CONC out this time.  Like thier father, two of Cunedda's sons and his grandso
2 CONC n had Christian names.  It can reasonably be deduced from this that Cuned
2 CONC da was a Christian.  This could have been an additional inducement for se
2 CONC nding him to Wales where his coming marks the opening of the early Middl
2 CONC e Ages.  He must have been an able solider and leader to have been able t
2 CONC o organise a successful invasion and settlement from so far away, and t
2 CONC o establish foundations which remained strong for so many centuries.

1 NOTE Vladimir was a semi-barbaric Viking tribal chief of great leadership abil
2 CONC ities; conquered and then was first ruler of a unified Russia; was baptis
2 CONC ed at Kherson in the Crimea in 988 and 'converted' his subjects to Christ
2 CONC ianity, and formed many alliances (many sealed with marriages of his chil
2 CONC dren) with the other leaders of Europe. His father sent him to govern Nov
2 CONC gorod in 970 despite his youth. He became Grand Duke, i.e. leader of hi
2 CONC s people, by killing his brother Yaropolk, uniting Novgorod and Kiev. Aft
2 CONC er becoming a Christian, Vladimir built churches, promoted charity, estab
2 CONC lished Orthodox canon law and married Princess Anna, sister of Byzantin
2 CONC e Emperor Basil II and daughter of Romanus II (Emperor 959-63) and his se
2 CONC cond wife Theophano. 'From the reign of Svyatoslav's youngest son, Vladim
2 CONC ir, the Norman dynasty was definitely settled in Kiev.' His feast day i

4 CONC edia Britanica, 1956, 19:692.
1 NOTE When his father was killed in 972 he was a contender for the rule of Kiev
2 CONC , together with his elder two brothers. Yarapolk, the eldest brother alre
2 CONC ady established in Kiev, disposed of Oleg the other brother and forced Vl
2 CONC adimir to flee the country. Vladimir went from Novgorod to Scandinavia, f
2 CONC rom where he returned with an army of Varangians, attacked and killed Yar
2 CONC opolk and in doing so became the sole ruler of Rus. In his early years a
2 CONC s a ruler he was brutal, bloodthirsty and dissolute. By his first wife, R
2 CONC ogneda of Polotzk, he had four sons and two daughters; by a Greek woman h
2 CONC e fathered one son; by a Czech woman one son; two more sons by a differen
2 CONC t mother; and by a Bulgarian woman two more sons. Apparently he had thre
2 CONC e hundred concubines at Vyshegorod, three hundred at Belgorod, and two hu
2 CONC ndred at Berestovo. He had married women brought to him and as well deflo
2 CONC wered virgins. At the beginning of his long reign he continued attackin
2 CONC g the Byzantine Empire. However, he soon realised that it was better to b
2 CONC e on good terms with his neighbours and adopted Christianity for himsel
2 CONC f and his people. This happened around 988 when he also took as his thir
2 CONC d wife the sister of the Byzantine Emperor. However, the Pechenegs contin
2 CONC ued to harass him and he had to fight them continually until the end of h
2 CONC is reign. After his conversion Vladimir became a changed man; he became m
2 CONC ild towards criminals, generous to the poor and supported the Greek missi
2 CONC onaries. This resulted in a picture of him that caused later generation
2 CONC s to look on St. Vladimir and his grandmother, St. Olga, as the first-bor
2 CONC n of the new Christian people of Russia and her borderland. They were est
2 CONC eemed to be saints and Vladimir became the subject of a cycle of folklor
2 CONC e and heroic poems.

2 TYPE Anecdote
2 NOTE After her husband had established peace, he wanted to increase the tribut
3 CONC es from the Slavic tribe of the Derevlyanins. In 945 he went and, after p
3 CONC illaging them, returned to Kiev. However, when he prepared to leave again
3 CONC , the Derevlyanins went to meet him and killed him. The Derevlyanins the
3 CONC n sent twenty of their best men to Olga and said: "We have killed your hu
3 CONC sband, for he was like a wolf, stealing and plundering, while our prince
3 CONC s are good and have taken good care of the land of Dereva. Marry our prin
3 CONC ce Mal!" To this she replied that she couldn't resurrect her husband an
3 CONC d so asked them to come the next day to be honoured before the people o
3 CONC f Kiev. She told them that as a special honour they should not ride on ho
3 CONC rses nor go on foot, but would be carried in the boat they arrived in. Du
3 CONC ring the night, a deep pit was dug and the following day, as was announce
3 CONC d, the twenty men were carried in their boat, but which was then thrown i
3 CONC nto the pit where they were buried alive. She then sent a message to th
3 CONC e Derevlyanins in which she claimed that the people of Kiev would not rel
3 CONC ease her unless she was collected by their most distinguished men. On the
3 CONC ir arrival Olga ordered a bath to be prepared for them. The hut was heate
3 CONC d up and the Derevlyanins went in. When they began to wash, Olga's men se
3 CONC cured the hut and, on her orders, set it on fire, and all inside were bur
3 CONC ned alive. With her son and their army, she then went to the city of Isko
3 CONC rosten where her husband had been killed. Although they encircled the cit
3 CONC y, they were unable to take it. After the siege had lasted almost the who
3 CONC le summer, she decided to take a different course. She sent a message t
3 CONC o the town that they would be starved as they could not work their fields
3 CONC , and that she only wanted them to pay tribute. For this tribute she requ
3 CONC ested three doves and three sparrows from each house. Gladly consenting
3 CONC , the Derevlyanins collected three doves and three sparrows from each hou
3 CONC se. Olga then announced that, as they had submitted to her, she would ret
3 CONC urn to Kiev the next day. However, Olga then distributed the doves and sp
3 CONC arrows with the order that lighted tinder, wrapped in little pieces of cl
3 CONC oth, be tied to each dove and sparrow. At dusk the birds were released, t
3 CONC he doves returning to their dove-cotes and the sparrows to their nests un
3 CONC der the eaves. Consequently, dove-cotes, outbuildings, towers and barns a
3 CONC ll caught fire, and there was no household where there was no fire. The p
3 CONC eople fled the town, only to be caught by Olga's soldiers. She then burne
3 CONC d the whole city, killing some of it's people and selling others as slave
3 CONC s. In 955 she went to Constantinople where the Emperor baptised her perso
3 CONC nally. At first the Emperor had wanted to marry her but then gave her man
3 CONC y gifts and allowed her to return. She tried to convert her son to Christ
3 CONC ianity but he refused, yet would allow anyone in Kiev to be baptised bu
3 CONC t with the proviso that they would be ridiculed. In 965 her son, as rule
3 CONC r of Kiev, defeated the Khazars, the Ossetians and the Circussians. Whil
3 CONC e he was away in 968, the Pechenegs laid siege to Kiev where Olga was wit
3 CONC h her grandsons. With Kiev hermetically sealed, no one could send a messa
3 CONC ge to her son until a young boy said he would go. He went with a bridle i
3 CONC n his hands, calling out, "Has no one seen my horse?" As he spoke the Pec
3 CONC henegs language, they thought him one of their own. At the river he too
3 CONC k off his clothes and swam across. Here he found a small band of soldier
3 CONC s who, next morning, approached the city in small boats. On arrival the
3 CONC y blew hard on their trumpets, creating the impression of being a large f
3 CONC orce, at which the Pechenegs fled.

1 NOTE On July 24 (July 11 old calendar), Orthodox Christians celebrate the da
2 CONC y of Saint Olga, the Grand Princess of Kiev. 
2 CONT A legend says that Olga's fabulous beauty fascinated Prince Igor of Kiev
2 CONC . That's how Olga became the princess. The name and the birth place of th
2 CONC e future enlightener of the Russian land was mentioned for the first tim
2 CONC e in the Russian Primary Chronicle, in the part that narrates about Igor'
2 CONC s marriage: "and thou brought him wife from Pskov and Olga was her name"
2 CONC . The city of Pskov is now the center of Russia's north-western region. 
2 CONT When her husband was killed by the hostile tribe of Drevlians, Olga bega
2 CONC n to rule the princedom on behalf of her juvenile son Svyatoslav. 
2 CONT Grand Princess Olga went down to history as the creator of state and cul
2 CONC ture of Rus. She has done a lot to unite the lands of Russia and to reinf
2 CONC orce the country. 
2 CONT When already an adult, Olga was baptized in Constantinopolis and accepte
2 CONC d the name of Helen. It was the emperor of Constantinopolis, Emperor Cons
2 CONC tantine the Bagryanorodni , who became her godfather. In Russia Olga comm
2 CONC enced erection of Christian temples and the preparation for the conversio
2 CONC n of the Russian people to Orthodoxy. Saint Olga passed away in 969. 
2 CONT The baptizing of Rus took place in 988 during the reign of her grandso
2 CONC n - Grand Prince Vladimir.

2 CONC atinate, Baden-WUrttemberg, and Hesse, and East Franconia, now in the Lan
2 CONC der of Baden-WUrttemberg and Bavaria. The Franks forcibly settled the re
2 CONC gion from the early 6th century AD, and in the early 8th century the Mero
2 CONC vingian dynasty claimed it as a royal demesne (crown land). After the div
2 CONC ision of the Carolingian empire under the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Franco
2 CONC nia became the nucleus of the East Frankish (German) kingdom, and, when t
2 CONC he Carolingian line died out, Franconia's duke became the first elected G
2 CONC erman king as Conrad I (911_'918). In 919 the German crown passed to a S
2 CONC axon dynasty. Franconia remained a royal demesne nurturing no strong duca
2 CONC l dynasty, and their tenure of it provided a support to German kings an
2 CONC d Holy Roman emperors. By the 12th century, the name had come to refer on

1 NOTE Chilperic I b. c. 539 d. , September or October 584, Chelles, France M
2 CONC erovingian king of Soissons whom Gregory of Tours, a contemporary, calle
2 CONC d the Nero and the Herod of his age. Son of Chlotar I by Aregund, Chilpe
2 CONC ric shared with his three half brothers (sons of Ingund, Aregund's sister
2 CONC ) in the partition that followed their father's death in 561, receiving t
2 CONC he poorest region, the kingdom of Soissons. To this was added, however, t
2 CONC he best part of Charibert's lands on the latter's death in 567 or 568, s
2 CONC o that Chilperic's kingdom corresponded in large part to that later know
2 CONC n as Neustria. In 568 he repudiated his wives in order to marry Galswinth
2 CONC a, sister of the Visigothic princess, Brunhild, who had herself recentl
2 CONC y married his half brother, Sigebert I; but he soon had Galswintha murder
2 CONC ed and immediately married Fredegund, an earlier mistress. The consequenc
2 CONC es of this crime constitute virtually the only clearly discernible threa
2 CONC d in the tangled skein of Frankish history over the next four decades, a
2 CONC s first Sigebert, whose relations with Chilperic had in fact been bad fro
2 CONC m the start, and then his descendants, incited by Brunhild, sought reveng
2 CONC e for Galswintha's murder upon the persons of Chilperic, Fredegund, and t
2 CONC heir family. Saved from apparent disaster by the assassination of Sigebe
2 CONC rt I in 575, Chilperic was prevented from seizing the lands of the dead k
2 CONC ing's young heir, Childebert II, by the action of Guntram, his third hal
2 CONC f brother and the king of Burgundy. Although Chilperic succeeded in formi
2 CONC ng an alliance with Childebert against Guntram by recognizing the young k
2 CONC ing as his heir (581), this was short-lived; in 583 Childebert and Guntra
2 CONC m again came to terms. A year later Chilperic fell victim to an unknown a
2 CONC ssassin, leaving a four-month-old son, Chlotar II. Ambitious, brutal, an
2 CONC d debauched, Chilperic nevertheless had pretensions to being a man of lea
2 CONC rning; he wrote poor poetry, became involved in theological matters, an
2 CONC d ordered four letters to be added to the alphabet. Regarding the churc
2 CONC h as a major rival to his wealth, he treated the bishops with hostility a
2 CONC nd contempt; at the same time, he had a reputation for injustice toward h
2 CONC is subjects at large and imposed heavy taxes.

1 NOTE When his father died, in the divison of his lands Chilperich I received t
2 CONC he poorest region, the kingdom of Soissons. However, when his half-brothe
2 CONC r Charibert died, he received the better parts of his lands. He repudiate
2 CONC d his wife to be able to marry the Visigoth princess Galsvintha, but the
2 CONC n murdered the latter to marry Fredegunde, his mistress. This sparked a f
2 CONC amily feud as his half-brother Sigebert I was married to Galsvintha's sis
2 CONC ter. Attacked and defeated by Sigebert I, he seemed vanquished until Fred
2 CONC egunde had Sigebert I murdered. Chilperich then tried to take his lands b

1 NOTE FROM: www.britannia.com/bios/ebk/coelhnt.html Coel Hen, King of Norther
2 CONC n Britain (c.350-c.420) (Welsh-Coel, Latin-Coelius, English-Cole) Coe
2 CONC l Hen or Coel the Old is known to most of us through the famous nursery r
2 CONC hyme: Old King Cole was a merry old soul And a merry old soul was he
2 CONC . He called for his pipe, And he called for his bowl, And he calle
2 CONC d for his fiddlers, three. He is also a familiar figure in ancient Wels
2 CONC h genealogies, for most of the Celtic British monarchies claimed descen
2 CONC t from him in one form or another. He appears to have lived around the tu
2 CONC rn from the 4th to the 5th century, the time when the Roman officials ret
2 CONC urned to Italy, leaving Britain and her people to fend for themselves. Co
2 CONC el's particular association with the north of Britain has led to the sugg
2 CONC estion that he may actually have been the last of the Roman Duces Brittan
2 CONC niarum with his headquarters at York. He certainly imposed his power ove
2 CONC r a great swathe of the country, and can be considered the first King i
2 CONC n Northern Britain. (This Coel should not be confused with the legendar
2 CONC y Coel Godhebog 'the Magnificent', Lord of Colchester, whose daughter, St
2 CONC . Helen, supposedly married the Emperor Constantius Chlorus two centurie
2 CONC s earlier.) There is an old story told in the north about Coel's last ca
2 CONC mpaign. What is now Scotland was originally inhabited by the Pictish race
2 CONC . It was during Coel's time that immigrant Irishmen from the Scotti trib
2 CONC e began to settle the Western coast around Argyle. Coel, fearing that th
2 CONC e two peoples would unite against the British, sent raiding parties acros
2 CONC s his northern border to stir up discord between them. The plan, however
2 CONC , backfired for the Picts and the Scots were not taken in. Coel merely su
2 CONC cceeded in pushing the two even closer together, and they began to attac
2 CONC k the British Kingdom of Strathclyde. Coel declared all out war and move
2 CONC d north to expel the invaders. The Picts and Scots fled to the hills ahea
2 CONC d of Coel's army, who eventually set up camp at what became Coylton along
2 CONC side the Water of Coyle (Ayrshire). For a long time, the British were tri
2 CONC umphant, while the Scots and Picts starved. Desperate for some relief, ho
2 CONC wever, the enemy advanced an all-or-nothing attack on Coel's stronghold
2 CONC . Coel and his men were taken by surprise, overrun and scattered to the w
2 CONC inds. It is said that Coel wandered the unknown countryside until he even
2 CONC tually got caught in a bog at Coilsfield (in Tarbolton, Ayrshire) and dro
2 CONC wned. Coel was first buried in a mound there before being removed to th
2 CONC e church at Coylton. The year was about AD 420. After his death, Coel's N
2 CONC orthern Kingdom was divided between two of his sons, Ceneu and Gorbanian
2 CONC . FROM: P L Kessler <plk@globalnet.co.uk>, The History Files, Home Publis
2 CONC hing A(c)1999, www.users.globalnet.co.uk\\_plk\\history.htm, Internet Co
2 CONC el Hen Coel Hen is a familiar figure in many ancient Welsh genealogies
2 CONC . Most of the Celtic British kings of the north of Britain could trace th
2 CONC eir descent from him in one form or another, as could many Welsh kings. I
2 CONC n the short time after his life that Central and Northern Britain remaine
2 CONC d free of the invading Angles, between the start of the fifth century an
2 CONC d mid-sixth century, all of the kingdoms that were established were by hi
2 CONC s sons or grandsons. Although the evidence is typically patchy, he appear
2 CONC s to have lived from around 350 - 420, during the time when the last Roma
2 CONC n officials returned to the heart of the faltering empire, leaving Britai
2 CONC n and her people to fend for themselves. Coel's particular association w
2 CONC ith the north of Britain has led to the well-founded suggestion that he w
2 CONC as the last of the Roman Duces Brittanniarum (Dukes of the Britons). Onl
2 CONC y one existed at any time. They were selected as generals of the army wit
2 CONC h direct authority from the governor of Britannia to defend the coast fro
2 CONC m the increasing barbarian raids). The Roman dux disappear from the Notit
2 CONC ia Dignitatum in about 400 and it is not unnatural to presume that Coel t
2 CONC ook his place. He seems to have made his headquarters at Britain's northe
2 CONC rn capital of Eburacum (York), and he certainly imposed his power ove
2 CONC r a great swathe of the country. Coel Hen can be considered by traditio
2 CONC n to be the first king in, and of, Northern Britain, as seems to have ove
2 CONC rseen the transition from direct Roman rule to an independent Britain whi
2 CONC ch took care of its own defence. In the Celtic tradition, because of hi
2 CONC s dominance, he is known fully as the High King of Northern Britain (as o
2 CONC pposed to other major kings of his generation, such as Cunedda Wledig, wh
2 CONC o was King of North Wales - later Gwynedd, or Antonius Donatus Gregoriu
2 CONC s (Anwn), who was King of South Wales - Demetia). From his headquarter
2 CONC s Coel Hen governed the territory between Eburacum and Hadrian's Wall (wh
2 CONC ich formed the later British kingdoms of Ebrauc, Deywr, and Bernaccia), a
2 CONC nd west to cover the area of Rheged, (later North Rheged, South Rheged, D
2 CONC unoting, Elmet, Caer-Guendoleu, and a kingdom which, to deduce its name f
2 CONC rom the later Saxon Pecset, was probably called the Kingdom of the Peak)
2 CONC . According to later claims, he also had a hand in structuring the Goutod
2 CONC din in the eastern territory between the Walls after the departure of Cun
2 CONC edda Wledig. As a result of the many kingdoms which were inherited by hi
2 CONC s immediate descendants, Coel became the founding ancestor of what came t
2 CONC o be known as The Men of the North (Gwyr y Gogledd). These were the Brito
2 CONC ns of the surviving kingdoms who were fighting the advancing Angles in th
2 CONC e 6th and 7th centuries. They were drawn from the kingdoms of Goutoddin a
2 CONC nd Rheged, from Strathclyde and various minor principalities, and togethe
2 CONC r they upheld the tradition of battling Celtic warriors, feasting togethe
2 CONC r before riding out with the warband to do battle with the enemy. Their s
2 CONC tubborn resistance was dealt a fatal blow at Catreath (Catterick) in arou
2 CONC nd 600, and these events (detailed in The Mabinogion) cemented the reputa
2 CONC tion of The Men of the North in their glorious, but ultimately futile, ef
2 CONC forts of resistance to the Teutonic invaders. Most people today will hav
2 CONC e heard of Coel Hen (or 'King Coel' - with 'Hen' the Brito-Welsh word fo
2 CONC r 'old'), even if they don't realise it. He is immortalised in verse: Ol
2 CONC d King Cole was a merry old soul And a merry old soul was he. He calle
2 CONC d for his pipe, And he called for his bowl, And he called for his fiddl
2 CONC ers, three  The legends of the Northern British were preserved by Rhodr
2 CONC i Mawr, when he became King of Gwynedd. One of those legends concerned Co
2 CONC el Hen's last campaign. It was during Coel's time as High King that immig
2 CONC rant Irishmen from the Scotti tribe of Dalriata (in the region of Ulster
2 CONC ) began to settle the western coast of Pictland, around Argyle. Coel, fea
2 CONC ring that the two peoples would unite against the British, sent raiding p
2 CONC arties across his northern border to stir up discord between them. The pl
2 CONC an backfired as the Picts and the Scots were not taken in. Coel merely su
2 CONC cceeded in pushing the two even closer together, and they began to attac
2 CONC k the British Kingdom of Strathclyde. Coel declared all out war and move
2 CONC d north to expel the invaders. The Picts and Scots fled to the hills ahea
2 CONC d of Coel's army, who eventually set up camp at what became Coylton along
2 CONC side the Water of Coyle (Ayrshire). For a long time, the British were vic
2 CONC torious, while the Scots and Picts starved. Desperate for some relief, th
2 CONC e enemy advanced in a last-ditch attack on Coel's stronghold. Coel and hi
2 CONC s men were taken by surprise, overrun and scattered to the winds. It is s
2 CONC aid that Coel wandered the unknown countryside until he eventually got ca
2 CONC ught in a bog at Coilsfield (in Tarbolton, Ayrshire) and drowned. Coel wa
2 CONC s first buried in a mound there before being removed to the church at Coy
2 CONC lton. The year was circa AD 420. After his death, Coel's Northern Kingdo
2 CONC m was divided between two of his sons: Ceneu (St) assumed control of th
2 CONC e kingdoms of the North & Midland Britain, remaining based at Ebrauc. Go
2 CONC rbanian founded the dynasty that ruled over the Kingdom of Bernaccia (Bry
2 CONC neich), which was later taken over by the Angles, who pronounced it Berni
2 CONC cia. Because of Coel's, and his son's, apparently continued use of Ebura
2 CONC cum as a base of operations and also as the traditional Roman capital o
2 CONC f North Britain, it makes sense to list the Kings of North Britain alongs
2 CONC ide the Kings of Ebrauc (as the evolving Brito-Welsh language dubbed it)
2 CONC . There were only three of the former, with the next in line ruling onl
2 CONC y half the land of his father, as the rest of it had been inherited by hi
2 CONC s brother. Magnus Maximus (Macsen Wledig) 383 - 388 AD Western Roman E
2 CONC mperor 383-388. Selected Coel Hen as his replacement in most of Norther
2 CONC n Britain. 400 AD The reorganisations of Magnus Maximus and his subsequ
2 CONC ent withdrawal of troops from Britain virtually signals the end of Roma
2 CONC n rule over the island. From this point on, all of Britain's High Kings o
2 CONC riginate from within the country.

1 NOTE Beli (Heli) Mawr(the Great) the 64th King of Britain, born Briton abt. 11
2 CONC 0 b.c. died 62 b.c. married Don ferch Mathonwy. (c) A semi-legendary Brit
2 CONC ish king who was probably an historical ruler, though any facts have beco
2 CONC me so covered by the dust of myth that it is impossible to be certain abo
2 CONC ut his true basis.  Bel was the name of one of the principal Celtic deiti
2 CONC es, the god of the sun and of light, and it is not surprising that the na
2 CONC me would be adopted by later warrior kings, though how much the episode
2 CONC s about Bel in myth are derived from those of a real king of that name (o
2 CONC r vice versa) cannot be determined.  To have acquired the cognomen Mawr m
2 CONC ust mean that Beli was a great king and it is likely that he was one of t
2 CONC he first to impose his authority over many of the tribes of Britain, mos
2 CONC t likely over southern Britain and Wales.  The Welsh legends make him th
2 CONC e father of LUD and Llefelys and possible of Caswallon.  Since Caswallo
2 CONC n was High King at the time of Caesar's invasion, this would place Beli'
2 CONC s existence at the start of the first centruy BC.  It is possible to trac
2 CONC e most of the British and Welsh rulers back to Beli. Beli (Heli) Mawr C
2 CONC alled Belenos by the Romans, was the Celtic God of the Sun, representin
2 CONC g the curative powers of the Sun's heat.  His festival of Beltane, when b
2 CONC onfires were lit to welcome in the Summer and encourage the Sun's warmth
2 CONC , was held on May 1st, and is remembered in today's May Day festivities
2 CONC .  His symbols were the horse (as shown, for example, by the clay horse f
2 CONC igurine offerings at Beli's Sainte-Sabine shrine in Burgundy), and also t
2 CONC he Wheel (as illustrated on the famous Gundestrup Cauldron). Perhaps, lik
2 CONC e Apollo, whom he became identified with, Beli was thought to ride the Su
2 CONC n across the sky in a horse-drawn chariot.  Indeed, a Celtic model hors
2 CONC e and wagon, carrying a gilded sun-disc, has been found at Trundholm in D
2 CONC enmark.  Sometimes he is illustrated riding a single horse, throuwing thu
2 CONC nder-bolts (hence an occasional idenification with Jupiter) and using hi
2 CONC s symbolic radiating wheel as a sheild, as he tramples the chthonic force
2 CONC s of a snake-limbed giant.  This personification is similar to the classi
2 CONC c depiction of the Archangel St. Michael defeating the Devil.  Sacred pag
2 CONC an hills associated with Beli, are thought to have had their dedication
2 CONC s transferred to this saint (or sometimes St. George) by the early Christ
2 CONC ians.  Well known examples include St. Michael's Mount (Cornwall) and th
2 CONC e churches of St. Michael on Brent Tor (Devon), and Burrow Mump and Glast
2 CONC onbury Tor (Somerset): All on a supposed ley line that faces the Rising S
2 CONC un at Beltane.  He may also have been worshipped on Dragon Hill below th
2 CONC e great Uffington White Horse in Berkshire.

1 NOTE Trusted advisor of Eudaf Hen of Gwent. Dumnonia This large and well-fou
2 CONC nded kingdom took in all of Cornwall (Cornubia), Devon, and much of Somer
2 CONC set. Its original capital would have been Isca (Exeter), but archaeolog
2 CONC y confirms that this was abandoned in the 5th century, and, given the adv
2 CONC ances of the West Saxons, the capital would continually have been relocat
2 CONC ed to the west. The main part of Dumnonia in modern Devon (the Defnas Bri
2 CONC tons) fell to Wessex between 650-670, while the Cornish remnant was indep
2 CONC endent until 825-829. Although under Roman control until the late 4th ce
2 CONC ntury, the Celtic tribe of the Dumnonii probably exercised a certain amou
2 CONC nt of self-government in their own lands. They most probably establishe
2 CONC d their kingdom as a power in its own right by the time of Magnus Maximus
2 CONC , as the latter prepared Britain's defences prior to establishing his ow
2 CONC n claim for control of the Roman Empire in AD 383, and Dumnonia was full
2 CONC y independent by 410. -------------------------------------------------
2 CONC - FROM: Encyclopedia Britannica, www.britannica.com, Internet. Caratacu
2 CONC s fl. 1st century AD also spelled CARACTACUS, CELTIC CARADOC, king of th
2 CONC e British tribe of Trinovantes, and the son of Cunobelinus. Caratacus' k
2 CONC ingdom, embracing the Atrebates of Hampshire and probably the Dobunni o
2 CONC f Gloucestershire, lay in the west. At the time of the Roman invasion o
2 CONC f Britain during the reign of Claudius, he led the native resistance agai
2 CONC nst Aulus Plautius (ad 43-47) and, after being defeated, withdrew into so

2 CONC . He and his family were featured in a victory parade of Claudius, who gr

2 CONC ----- FROM Britannia Internet Magazine, www.britannia.com, Internet. Car
2 CONC atacus. An historical person with some legendary accretions. Caratacus (s
2 CONC ometimes spelled Caractacus) was the king of the Catuvellauni at the tim
2 CONC e of the Roman invasion under the emperor, Claudius, and was the leader o
2 CONC f the anti-Roman campaign. His forces suffered several defeats by the Rom
2 CONC ans and, after a defeat at the hands of the then governor, Ostorious Scap
2 CONC ula, in 51 AD, Caratacus retreated to the land of the Brigantes in northe
2 CONC rn Britain. Unfortunately for Caratacus, Cartimandua, the Queen of the Br
2 CONC igantes, was bound by a client-ruler relationship with the Romans, so sh
2 CONC e handed Caratacus over to them. Caratacus was sent to Rome along with o
2 CONC ther captives, where he came to Claudius' attention, according to Tacitus
2 CONC , for his courtesy and bearing and so was pardoned. He and his family wer
2 CONC e permitted to live out their lives in peace in Italy. Some investigator
2 CONC s have come to the conclusion that Caratacus is the historic original fo
2 CONC r King Arthur, while others insist that he and Arviragus are one and th
2 CONC e same.

2 CONC .  Lludd Llaw Encint (or Llud) (the silver handed), born Britain abt. 8
2 CONC 0 b.c.. (c) Legendary king of the British mentioned in Geoffrey of Monmou
2 CONC th's History. Lud is listed as the eldest son of Heli (or Beli), and th
2 CONC e brother of the historically real Caswallon, which would place Lud's exi
2 CONC stence at about 60BC. Lud was that rare combination of warrior king and t
2 CONC own planner. He rebuilt New Troy, or Trinovantum as it was then known, an
2 CONC d renamed it KaerLud after him. This became Lud's Town or London. When h
2 CONC e died he was buried by the city wall where Ludgate is named after him. T
2 CONC here is a story of Lud in the Welsh tale 'Lludd and Llefelys' collected i
2 CONC n the Mabinogion, wherein Lud consults his brother Llefelys on how to com
2 CONC bat three supernatural plagues that are smiting Britain. He succeeds in d
2 CONC efeating the source of the plagues and rules peacefully thereafter. Thi
2 CONC s tale, like that of Merlin's, to which it is closely related, may be abo
2 CONC ut a real British prince who ruled later than Geoffrey's Lud, possible i
2 CONC n the first or second centruy AD. He has become remembered in Welsh legen
2 CONC d as the Celtic god Llud, also known as Nudd, the Celtic form of Nodens
2 CONC . A temple to Nodens was built at Lydney in Gloucestershire, where ther
2 CONC e are other places starting with Lyd-, and which may have some relation t
2 CONC o a local prince who assumed the name Lud. Lludd Llaw Encint (the silve
2 CONC r handed) Called Nodens by the Romans, was the Celtic god of Healing. H
2 CONC e had a large shrine at Lydney in Gloucesterhire, where the devoted mad
2 CONC e offerings of small bronze representations of their deseased limbs. He w
2 CONC as sometimes identified with the protective Mars or the regenerative Silv
2 CONC anus and his companion and symbol was the dog: a deerhound whose lick cou
2 CONC ld cure the afflicted. An old story explains his connection with amputees
2 CONC . At one time, Lludd was the leader of the gods, but he was wounded in ba
2 CONC ttle and lost his hand. Gorfannon, the divine-smith, made him a new one o
2 CONC ut of Silver, but he was still forced to abdicate in favour of his nephew
2 CONC , Lleu Llaw Gyffes. Later, Lludd was troubled by a constant scream that w
2 CONC as heard the eve of every Beltane. He traveled to Gaul, where his brothe
2 CONC r Llefelys, was particularly worshipped, to ask his advice. He explaine
2 CONC d that the cry was made by two fighting dragons. Lludd managed to captur
2 CONC e the creatures and imprisoned them deep below Dinas Emrys. Lludd may hav
2 CONC e been particularly worshipped in London, which was said to have been nam
2 CONC ed after him.

2 CONC la (born c.AD 305)(Welsh-Ursula, Latin-Ursula, English-Ursula) Though th
2 CONC ere are no ancient dedications to her in Britain, Ursula is said to hav
2 CONC e been a British Princess. After her father, 'King' Donaut, agreed to he
2 CONC r marriage with Governor Conan Meriadoc of Armorica (Brittany), she set s
2 CONC ail to join him along with 11,000 virginal handmaidens. However, a miracu
2 CONC lous storm brought them over the sea in a single day to a Gaulish port, w
2 CONC here Ursula declared that before her marriage she would undertake a pan-E
2 CONC uropean pilgrimage. Together, the British maidens headed for Rome where U
2 CONC rsula persuaded Pope Cyriacus and Sulpicius, Bishop of Ravenna to join he
2 CONC r happy band of followers. She was later welcomed Pantulus, Bishop of Bas
2 CONC le & Jaques, Bishop of Liege, and 'King' Ethereus arrived from Britain wi
2 CONC th Prince Conan himself. Together, they set out for Cologne which was bei
2 CONC ng besieged by Huns. In a dreadful massacre, the Huns beheaded all the vi
2 CONC rgins and, with bow & arrow, their leader shot St. Ursula dead. Ursula an
2 CONC d her virgins were buried in Cologne where a great church is dedicated t
2 CONC o her. Conan, her husband, apparently survived. Generally considered leg
2 CONC endary.

2 CONC : Coenwulf of Mercia signs two charters 'in vico celeberimmo qui vocatu

2 CONC t in the south-west corner of what was a Saxon burh, it's located to domi
2 CONC nate the approach over the two rivers which meet below the Castle. Its s
2 CONC andstone walls and superb herringbone wall - all that survives of the 'cu

2 CONC ced a palisade and wooden tower, built on the present artificial mound sh
2 CONC ortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Numerous additions and alterati
2 CONC ons have been made to the castle by succeeding generations of owners. Unt
2 CONC il in the late 1890's, Marquis Townshend decided to sell the Castle by au
2 CONC ction. Tamworth Corporation purchased it to mark Queen Victoria's Diamon
2 CONC d Jubilee in 1897. The purchase price of A3000 was later raised by publi

1 NOTE Caswallon, died about 48 BC. (c) The earliest known historical British ki
2 CONC ng, Caswallon (known to the Romans as Cassivelaunos) was ruler of the Cat
2 CONC uvellauni tribe who dominated the lands to the north of the Thames, and m
2 CONC ost of what is now Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire an
2 CONC d into Wiltshire. His stronghold was at what is now Wheathamstead. He wa
2 CONC s evidently a powerful warrior king able to establish himself as the high
2 CONC -king of the British tribes as, before Caesar's invasion of Britain in 5
2 CONC 5 BC, Caswallon had already attacked the tribe of the Trinovantes in Esse
2 CONC x and killed thier king Imanuentius. It is recorded that Caswallon had a
2 CONC n army of over 4,000 charioteers let alone infantry. Even these, though
2 CONC , were no match for the Romans. The fact that Caesar was unable to conque
2 CONC r Britain outright says something for the power and determination of th
2 CONC e British tribes and of Caswallon as leader. At some stage around 50 or 4
2 CONC 5 BC he was succeeded by his son Andoco with whom he perhaps showed par
2 CONC t of his territory, and subsequently by Tasciovanus, who may have been hi
2 CONC s son or nephew.

1 NOTE FROM: http://www.hickling.swinternet.co.uk/ Origins of the name Hicklin
2 CONC g The fact that the Mercian royal family was known as Icelingas strength
2 CONC ens the claim that it was Icel and his son Cnebba Iceling who came to Bri
2 CONC tain in AD 499. The Icelingas entered Britain through the estuaries of t
2 CONC he Wash and the Trent. They settled in navigable river valleys and area
2 CONC s served by Roman canals. Roman influence had wained some 100 years earli
2 CONC er although the network of roads and canals remained. The English settlem
2 CONC ents became part of a sophisticated and prosperous society never far awa
2 CONC y from means of communication by navigable rivers and canals or stone sur
2 CONC faced causeways and roads. Early pagan literature such as Beowulf, suppl
2 CONC emented by recent archaeological discoveries, provide insight into the be
2 CONC liefs of the Angles which were very similar to those of some non-christia
2 CONC n civilizations today. There was a belief in life hereafter and a profoun
2 CONC d respect for their ancestors. The more distant and admired ancestors ass
2 CONC umed in legend the stature of gods, e.g. Tiuw, Woden, Thor and Freyr, aft
2 CONC er whom the days of the week were named in Anglo-Saxon England. In 199
2 CONC 7 Northamptonshire archaeologists excavated a pagan and heroic burial i
2 CONC n the gravel plain of the Nene Valley at Wollaston. It was the grave of a
2 CONC n Anglian nobleman at the side of a road leading to a Roman vineyard an
2 CONC d has been dated about AD 650. The most important content of the grave wa
2 CONC s a boar-crested helmet like those so often referred to in Beowulf. The b
2 CONC oar which symbolised strength and was associated with the goddess Freyr w
2 CONC ould have been worn by Ickeling leaders of the time. 'He was a noblema
2 CONC n and the boar insignia on his helmet could mean that he was a prince. H
2 CONC e appears to have died when middle-aged, so he had probably become a wa
2 CONC r leader by fighting many bloody battles in his youth. He would have grow
2 CONC n up in a village, living in a timber-framed long-house with a thatched r
2 CONC oof. As an aristocrat he would have learned how to fight with a spear an
2 CONC d sword from an early age. He would have honed his skills hunting wild bo
2 CONC ar, deer, bear and wolf in the forests that covered the country. As he gr
2 CONC ew older he would have carved out a name for himself leading bands of me
2 CONC n into war against rival tribes. After a hard day of hunting and pillagin
2 CONC g he would have come home to his wives and children. A goat, sheep or par
2 CONC t of a cow would be thrown into the long-hut's cauldron and his band woul
2 CONC d drink beer, mead or wine. The prince would have led a very war-like lif
2 CONC estyle. Even when he died his sword was buried with hime to prepare him f
2 CONC or a similar existence in the after-life.' Prof. R Cramp of Durham Univer
2 CONC sity, England. From meagre surviving records it appears that the first k
2 CONC ing of Mercia was Creoda ruling from 585 and he was an Ickeling. He was s
2 CONC ucceeded by his son Pybba in 597. The most famous Ickeling and last of th
2 CONC e 'old pagan religion' was king Penda (582-654) and his genealogy links h
2 CONC im with Woden and his spouse Freyr. The penny coin is named after him
2 CONC . A formidable ruler he rivalled the power of the Christian Northumbria
2 CONC n kings. The rivalry between the two kingdoms was notorious. Penda had de
2 CONC feated and killed Edwin in 633 and Oswald in 642. Both Penda and his spou
2 CONC se Cyneuise remained lifelong adherents to their inherited beliefs at a t
2 CONC ime when the conversion of the English to Christianity was proceeding apa
2 CONC ce. Their eldest son Peada had been made Prince of the Middle Angles by P
2 CONC enda. In 653, Peada along with all the Middle Angles became Christian con
2 CONC verts in order to marry Alchfled, daughter of Penda's rival, king Oswy o
2 CONC f Northumbria. This did not deter Penda from continuing his campaigns aga
2 CONC inst Northumbria and in the following year on 15 Nov 654, Penda was defea
2 CONC ted and killed at the battle of the river Winwaed by Oswy and this was ha
2 CONC iled by Bede as a victory for Christ over the pagan gods. SOURCES: Bede

2 CONC e Rhine, settled in Kent and the Isle of Wight. The Anglo-Saxons eventual
2 CONC ly formed seven separate kingdoms known as the heptarchy. The term 'Anglo
2 CONC -Saxons' was first used in Continental Latin sources to distinguish the S
2 CONC axons in England from those on the Continent, but it soon came to mean si
2 CONC mply the 'English'. The more specific use of the term to denote the non-C
2 CONC eltic settlers of England prior to the Norman Conquest dates from the 16t
2 CONC h cent. In more modern times it has also been used to denote any of the p
2 CONC eople (or their descendants) of the British Isles.  Heptarchy (hpA'tark
2 CONC ) [Gr.,=seven-kingdom], name traditionally applied to the kingdoms of An
2 CONC glo-Saxon England in the period prior to the Danish conquests of the 9t
2 CONC h cent. The term was probably first used by 16th-century writers who beli
2 CONC eved that in those early years England was divided into seven kingdomsª'
2 CONC ?orthumbria, East Anglia, Mercia, Essex, Sussex, Wessex, and Kent. Actual
2 CONC ly the political and geographical divisions were neither so orderly nor p
2 CONC ermanent. At one time (c.600) there appear to have been as many as 12 ind
2 CONC ependent states, but the number of kingdoms, their boundaries, and thei
2 CONC r political status shifted constantly throughout this period.

1 NOTE The Roman Period 55 BC - 401 AD. AD 63 - Joseph of Arimathea came to Glas
2 CONC tonbury on the first Christian mission to Britain.
2 CONT Joseph of Arimathea was a wealthy disciple of Jesus, who, according to t
2 CONC he book of Matthew 27:57-60, asked Pontius Pilate for permission to tak
2 CONC e Jesus' dead body in order to prepare it for burial. He also provided th
2 CONC e tomb where the crucified Lord was laid until his Resurrection. Joseph i
2 CONC s mentioned in a few times in parallel passages in Mark, Luke and John, b
2 CONC ut nothing further is heard about his later activities.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Apocryphal legend, however, supplies us with the rest of his story by cl
2 CONC aiming that Joseph accompanied the Apostle Philip, Lazarus, Mary Magdalen
2 CONC e & others on a preaching mission to Gaul. Lazarus & Mary stayed in Marse
2 CONC illes, while the others travelled north. At the English Channel, St.Phili
2 CONC p sent Joseph, with twelve disciples, to establish Christianity in the mo
2 CONC st far-flung corner of the Roman Empire: the Island of Britain. The yea
2 CONC r AD 63 is commonly given for this "event", with AD 37 sometimes being pu
2 CONC t forth as an alternative. It was said that Joseph achieved his wealth i
2 CONC n the metals trade, and in the course of conducting his business, he prob
2 CONC ably became acquainted with Britain, at least the south-western parts o
2 CONC f it. Cornwall was a chief mining district and well-known in the Roman em
2 CONC pire for its tin. Somerset was reknowned for its high quality lead. Som
2 CONC e have even said that Joseph was the uncle of the Virgin Mary and therefo
2 CONC re of Jesus, and that he may have brought the young boy along on one of h
2 CONC is business trips to the island. Hence the words of Blake's famous hymn
2 CONC , Jerusalem:
2 CONT 
2 CONT And did those feet, in ancient time,
2 CONT Walk upon England's mountains green?
2 CONT 
2 CONT It was only natural, then, that Joseph should have been chosen for the f
2 CONC irst mission to Britain, and appropriate that he should come first to Gla
2 CONC stonbury, that gravitational center for legendary activity in the West Co
2 CONC untry. Local legend has it that Joseph sailed around Land's End and heade
2 CONC d for his old lead mining haunts. Here his boat ran ashore in the Glaston
2 CONC bury Marshes and, together with his followers, he climbed a nearby hill t
2 CONC o survey the surrounding land. Having brought with him a staff grown fro
2 CONC m Christ's Holy Crown of Thorns, he thrust it into the ground and announc
2 CONC ed that he and his twelve companions were "Weary All". The thorn staff im
2 CONC mediately took miraculous root, and it can be seen there still on Wearyal
2 CONC l Hill. Joseph met with the local ruler, Arviragus, and soon secured hims
2 CONC elf twelve hides of land at Glastonbury on which to build the first monas
2 CONC tery in Britain. From here he became the country's evangelist.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Much more was added to Joseph's legend during the Middle Ages. He was gr
2 CONC adually inflated into a major saint and cult hero, as well as the suppose
2 CONC d ancestor of many British monarchs. He is said to have brought with hi
2 CONC m to Britain a cup, said to have been used at the Last Supper and also us
2 CONC ed to catch the blood dripping from Christ as he hung on the Cross. A var
2 CONC iation of this story is that Joseph brought with him two cruets, one cont
2 CONC aining the blood and the other, the sweat of Christ. Either of these item
2 CONC s are known as The Holy Grail, and were the object(s) of the quests of th
2 CONC e Knights of King Arthur's Round Table. One legend goes on to suggest tha
2 CONC t Joseph hid the "Grail" in Chalice Well at Glastonbury for safe-keepin
2 CONC g (Photo)
2 CONT 
2 CONT There is a wide variance of scholarly opinion on this subject, however
2 CONC , and a good deal of doubt exists as to whether Joseph ever came to Brita
2 CONC in at all, for any purpose.

2 CONC s A personage who has come to our attention, first, in the writings of Ju
2 CONC venal, who mentions him in connection with resistance to Roman conquest a
2 CONC nd authority. Geoffrey of Monmouth refers to him as a British king whos
2 CONC e brother was killed sometime during Claudius' invasion (43 AD). He has b
2 CONC een linked with Caratacus, but more interestingly, he is said by the inte
2 CONC rpolators of William of Malmesbury's 'De Antiquitate Glastoniensis Eccles
2 CONC iae' to be the king who granted 12 hides of land around Glastonbury to Jo
2 CONC seph of Arimathea  and his band of followers, when they brought Christian
2 CONC ity to Britain for the first time in 63 AD. Some scholars think that it m
2 CONC ay have been Arviragus and his people who occupied the ancient hillfort
2 CONC , located in the county of Somerset, known as Cadbury Castle  (which woul
2 CONC d later come to be associated with King Arthur), and used it as a base fo
2 CONC r their resistance against the Romans.

2 CONT ...
2 CONT On June 14, German shells, the "moaning minnies," with their high pierci
2 CONC ng screech hailed down on the Battalion positions, hitting an ammunitio
2 CONC n dump in the unit's vehicle park. The fire burned throughout most of th
2 CONC e night. Fortunately, there were no injuries but five vehicles were destr
2 CONC oyed. In the three days between June 12 and 14, the Battalion sustaine
2 CONC d a further 14 fatalities.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On June 15, battalion headquarters fortuitously moved to a new positio
2 CONC n 400 yards further west. The headquarters had previously been located ne
2 CONC ar the church in Bretteville. Shortly after the headquarters moved, Germa
2 CONC n artillery destroyed the steeple with a direct hit, causing the bell an
2 CONC d spire to crash to the ground in rubble. The new battalion headquarter
2 CONC s position was also shelled that night. Because there had been no previou
2 CONC s shelling in that particular area there was a strong suspicion that th
2 CONC e Germans might have received information from an informer in the village
2 CONC . However, nothing could be proven. The shelling caused two more fataliti
2 CONC es for the Battalion. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT To Bray for a Rest
2 CONT 
2 CONT On June 17,1944, a fighting patrol sent out by C Company was caught in G
2 CONC erman crossfire. The patrol suffered 13 casualties, six of whom were fata
2 CONC l. During that day the Battalion was relieved in the line by the Queen'
2 CONC s Own Rifles, and moved back a couple of miles to Bray to rest. The Regin
2 CONC a Rifles had been continuously in the line for 11 days. On their first da
2 CONC y out of the line, June 18, it began to drizzle and continued raining fo
2 CONC r the first two days of their brief rest. This bad weather was to delay t
2 CONC he planned build-up of the Allied forces for their break-out into Normand
2 CONC y. The Rifles were to stay at Bray until June 29. During the following fe
2 CONC w days a course was held at the Battalion sniper school. Candidates wer
2 CONC e sent out to the front line for on the job training with live targets! D
2 CONC uring the rest period, the Battalion was visited by General Crerar and Ma
2 CONC jor General Keller who both expressed satisfaction with the Battalion's a
2 CONC ctions to that date, and with the way the men had conducted themselves. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Move Inland: Securing the Bridgehead
2 CONT 
2 CONT On June 19, a furious Channel storm broke up the Mulberry Harbour whic
2 CONC h had been towed over to Omaha Beach in the American assault sector. On S
2 CONC unday, June 25, Padre Jamieson held church services in the Company area
2 CONC s and finally, on June 26, the allied break-out in Normandy began. The Ba
2 CONC ttalion was put on one hour's notice to move from noon, but the order wa
2 CONC s rescinded and the men stood down at 1945 hours that night. On June 29
2 CONC , 1944, the Battalion moved back into the line. They left Bray for the vi
2 CONC llages of Rots and La Villeneuve to relieve the 7th Recce Regiment. Ther
2 CONC e the Battalion took up positions astride the Caen-Bayeux road to counte
2 CONC r the threat from German armour which might come from Caen where it had b
2 CONC een massing for yet another counter-attack. Dominion Day found the Battal
2 CONC ion digging in at La Villeneuve where A Company observed a German patro
2 CONC l that withdrew. The next day the Battalion was visited by Generals Stuar
2 CONC t, Keller, and Folkes.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In the chateau at Rots, Colonel Matheson held an officers' mess dinner w
2 CONC hile shells from Carpiquet and Abbey of Ardennes bounced off the walls. U
2 CONC tilizing their army rations, the officers dined off fine dinnerware fro
2 CONC m the Chateau recently abandoned by the owners. Although the food was poo
2 CONC r the wine from the cellars was good. Only half the officers of the Batta
2 CONC lion were able to attend; the others had to stay on duty in case of an at
2 CONC tack.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Carpiquet air field was one of the German strong points supposed to hav
2 CONC e been taken by 9th Brigade on D-Day or the day after. However, it did no
2 CONC t fall and remained a serious obstacle to the break-out. On July 4, a
2 CONC s a prelude to the attack on Caen, Operation WINDSOR was launched, in whi
2 CONC ch troops from 8th Brigade, including the Queens' Own Rifles and the Roya
2 CONC l Winnipeg Rifles detached from 7th Brigade for that operation, stormed C
2 CONC arpiquet and took it. The Reginas provided the fire support. When Matheso
2 CONC n went forward to get a better view from C Company's position, a dud Germ
2 CONC an artillery round caved in his trench but he survived.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Abbey of Ardennes
2 CONT On the night of July 7, Operation CHARNWOOD, a three division frontal as
2 CONC sault on Caen, began with the first time attempt to use heavy bombing a
2 CONC s a prelude to an attack by the army. The air attack devastated the city
2 CONC . The next day, the move towards Caen began. Units of 9th Brigade took Gr
2 CONC uchy, Buron, and Authie. Ardennes Abbey was being used by the 12th SS Pan
2 CONC zer Regiment as a headquarters and was heavily defended with mortars, mac
2 CONC hine guns, and 75mm guns. On July 8, the Regina Rifles were tasked to cap
2 CONC ture it.
2 CONT 
2 CONT To capture the Abbey, Matheson planned to attack with three companies, B
2 CONC , C, and D, and keep the still under strength A Company in reserve. Befor
2 CONC e attempting the assault on the Abbey, Gordon Brown and Major Tubb di
2 CONC d a careful reconnaissance. They climbed a church steeple north of Rots w
2 CONC here they were able to see the fields stretching out between Authie and t
2 CONC he Abbey. They didn't like what they saw. The area was flat, open, and de
2 CONC void of cover where an attacking force would easily be seen. What is more
2 CONC , the defenders had the advantage of dug in defences and clear fields o
2 CONC f fire.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The North Nova Scotia Regiment had reached Authie at 1600 hours. H hou
2 CONC r for the Reginas' attack was set at 1700 hours. At that time of year, th
2 CONC e sun did not set until around 10:30 so the attack would take place in da
2 CONC ylight. B Company, under Major Eric Syme, was the first to move to the Ba
2 CONC ttalion start line at Authie. As the Company went forward from the assemb
2 CONC ly area, two German machine guns opened up on the advancing troops inflic
2 CONC ting heavy casualties. Circumstances were such that B Company received li
2 CONC ttle artillery or armoured support. In spite of the concentrated machin
2 CONC e gun fire, the company struggled through Authie and reached their firs
2 CONC t objective, some mounds between them and the abbey. They had taken 61 ca
2 CONC sualties in this short advance. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT C Company moved to its start line at 1725 hours also under heavy fire. H
2 CONC owever, it pushed on, passing through B Company's position, and struggle
2 CONC d over the open area towards the abbey. They were hit with tank and accur
2 CONC ate mortar fire which caused many casualties, including the company comma
2 CONC nder, Major Tubb and all the officers and senior NCOs. Only 21 men of th
2 CONC e Company remained in action and they were forced to withdraw to B Compan
2 CONC y's position under fire.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the left, with C Company, D Company moved forward from Authie to with
2 CONC in 500 yards of the abbey also under machine gun and rifle fire. Each o
2 CONC f the platoons wriggled forward using fire and movement. Sections shifte
2 CONC d under covering fire of other sections, and the men were forced to craw
2 CONC l or run in shorts bursts. One of the company's platoons deployed in a le
2 CONC ft flanking attack while the other two platoons attacked under the cove
2 CONC r of smoke fired from their two inch mortars. The ragged platoons finall
2 CONC y reached their objective, the east side of the abbey, at 2230 hours.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Gordon Brown returned from the abbey and guided A Company forward in th
2 CONC e failing light to help consolidate the position sustaining 15 casualtie
2 CONC s on the way. All night long, the men held on behind the wall of the abbe
2 CONC y, against a deadly hail of German machine gun fire from as close as 20
2 CONC 0 yards. After a fierce fire fight at first light the abbey was secured a
2 CONC nd the Germans driven out. As the German counter fire slackened, the men'
2 CONC s spirits were given a further boost by their uncovering the abbey's win
2 CONC e stock!
2 CONT 
2 CONT The Battalion suffered 11 officer and 205 other ranks casualties, 36 o
2 CONC f them fatal, with one missing in action. This had been the worst fightin
2 CONC g for the Battalion since D-Day. The capture of the abbey by the Rifles h
2 CONC elped pierce the ring of defences of Caen. That action, and the success o
2 CONC f British forces on the left flank of the Canadians, forced the Germans t
2 CONC o withdraw back into Caen itself. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Caen
2 CONT A short time later the depleted Battalion moved to St. Germain, a subur
2 CONC b on the western outskirts of Caen. Here it was visited by General Crera
2 CONC r and Brigadier Foster. On July 10, after prolonged and heavy fighting, C
2 CONC aen fell to the Allies. On that day the headquarters of 2nd Canadian Corp
2 CONC s under Lieutenant General Guy Simonds arrived in France, and the comman
2 CONC d of 3rd Canadian Division passed to 2nd Canadian Corps. The Battalion wa
2 CONC s then moved to another section of Caen to become the brigade reserve bat
2 CONC talion. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT During its brief stay in Caen, the Battalion mounted the 1st Ceremonia
2 CONC l Guard. One hundred men, under Captain J. Treleaven, were issued new bat
2 CONC tledress, belts, and anklets, and were taken by vehicle to the centre o
2 CONC f Caen where they mounted guard at La Place St. Martin. There they were i
2 CONC nspected by the Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Simonds, and the Cana
2 CONC dian Red Ensign was unfurled for the first time in France. On July 13, th
2 CONC e command of the guard was passed to Captain Hector Jones. At midnight o
2 CONC n July 13, the Battalion moved to the Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry Hig
2 CONC hlanders. The relief was completed by 0230 hours under heavy German morta
2 CONC r and artillery fire from positions across the Orne River. On July 14, th
2 CONC e Battalion scout officer. Lieutenant Bergeron, took his men forward to c
2 CONC omplete a reconnaissance in the German held territory. At 2330 hours Berg
2 CONC eron's patrol moved across the Epron Bridge, a partially destroyed railwa
2 CONC y bridge, leading to the city of Vaucelles. The bridge crossed the Orne a
2 CONC bout 1,000 yards to the left front of the Battalion's position. The Germa
2 CONC ns had not withdrawn from Vaucelles, and were still manning the trenche
2 CONC s which constituted the city's defence. While the patrol was out on its r
2 CONC econnaissance, A and D Companies were withdrawn to the town of Epron fo
2 CONC r a rest. Bergeron and his patrol returned without incident. On July 16
2 CONC , the remainder of the Battalion was also withdrawn to Epron, being relie
2 CONC ved by the 7th Recce Regiment. While they were in Epron the Battalion beg
2 CONC an preparations for its assault across the Orne.
2 CONT 
2 CONT First Across The Orne
2 CONT On July 18, orders arrived. Operation GOODWOOD, the British armoured bre
2 CONC akout offensive across the River Orne southeast of Caen, was to be launch
2 CONC ed. Operation ATLANTIC, the Canadian part of GOODWOOD, also began. The 3r
2 CONC d Canadian Division was given the task of crossing the Orne River and cap
2 CONC turing Vaucelles. As part of the operation, the Reginas were to get acros
2 CONC s the river and link up with units of the 9th Brigade on their left. Civi
2 CONC lians together with members of the French Interior Force (FFI) were to ac
2 CONC t as guides to the Battalion. Guides were attached to each of the compani
2 CONC es and given battle dress and regimental flashes. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In preparation for the assault, 1,000 Lancaster and Halifax bombers wer
2 CONC e sent over to attack the factory areas at Colombelles and Vaucelles. T
2 CONC o beef up the weight of fire, an intense artillery bombardment was added
2 CONC . The Regina Rifles were put on one hour notice to move to their concentr
2 CONC ation area at 0800 hours. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Shortly after this initial phase of the attack, Lieutenant Bergeron agai
2 CONC n led a patrol across the Orne, this time in daylight, to determine if, a
2 CONC s a result of the heavy pounding the Germans had withdrawn. The patrol sc
2 CONC urried across the Orne over two wrecked bridges under intense German fir
2 CONC e which killed one man. Machine gun fire raked the bridge, pinning down t
2 CONC he patrol's communications group, who had set up their 46 Set on the Cae
2 CONC n side of the river. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Meanwhile the Battalion began moving to its forming up positions at St
2 CONC . Julien with A and D Companies moving out to their start line at 1500 ho
2 CONC urs. Their passage was obstructed by heaps of rubble caused by the previo
2 CONC us intense bombing and shelling. With C and B Companies following, the le
2 CONC ad companies began to cross the Orne on a two company front at two separa
2 CONC te points.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On the other side of the river, the isolated patrol was in desperate nee
2 CONC d of reinforcements but none were available. Accordingly Bergeron decide
2 CONC d to construct a passageway over a gap in the bridge, where the centre ha
2 CONC d collapsed but he came under increasing small arms and automatic fire fr
2 CONC om German positions and had to go to ground.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The carrier platoon and the battalion mortars now moved into position o
2 CONC n the north bank of the Orne to give covering fire for the crossing. By 1
2 CONC 700 hours, German fire had been neutralized and by 1715 hours the hazardo
2 CONC us crossing began. A and B Companies and the Carrier platoon got across t
2 CONC he river and began to clear out snipers on the other side. D Company, o
2 CONC n the left hand crossing, was delayed by accurate German mortar and machi
2 CONC ne gun fire which damaged the company's assault boats. They finally manag
2 CONC ed their crossing by bridge, followed shortly by C Company. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT By 2100 hours, all the companies of the Battalion had struggled across a
2 CONC nd were in position on their final objectives. The Battalion suffered 1
2 CONC 8 casualties, including three fatalities in this hard fought engagement
2 CONC , but as a result could proudly claim the distinction of being the firs
2 CONC t Canadian infantry to cross the Orne. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT On July 19, the companies tightened up their defensive positions in Vauc
2 CONC elles, and completed their mopping up operations. To that date they had t
2 CONC aken 60 to 70 prisoners and   more kept trickling in. Also on that day th
2 CONC e remainder of 7th Brigade crossed the Orne, and a patrol from the Battal
2 CONC ion was sent to the area that the Royal Winnipeg Rifles were to occupy. T
2 CONC he patrol bagged seven more prisoners of war, two motor cycles, two bottl
2 CONC es of cognac, and were treated to excellent meals. Here, unfortunately, t
2 CONC he Battalion suffered two more fatalities. On July 20 and 21, while the r
2 CONC est of the British and Allied forces were crossing the Orne on their wa
2 CONC y to Falaise, the Battalion remained at Vaucelles for a brief breathing s
2 CONC pell. At this time things were not going well for Germany. A sign of ho
2 CONC w bad things were occurred on July 20 when senior German army officers un
2 CONC successfully attempted to assassinate Hitler. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT On July 22, while still at Vaucelles, the Battalion was treated to a mob
2 CONC ile bath parade with the accompanying exchange of socks, shirts, and unde
2 CONC rwear. Both the Roman Catholic and Protestant chaplains conducted churc
2 CONC h services. That night, at 1730 hours, a nasty surprise in the form o
2 CONC f a "buzz bomb" landed in Caen, and a marked increase in German air attac
2 CONC ks occurred from which the Battalion suffered a number of casualties.

2 CONT On July 23,1944, the 1st Canadian Army headquarters under Lieutenant Gen
2 CONC eral H.D.G. Crerar became operational in France. Plans for the breakout o
2 CONC f the Allied armies from the Normandy beachhead were now being put into o
2 CONC peration. The America forces began their offensive, Operation COBRA, unde
2 CONC r General Omar N. Bradley on July 25. At the same time the Canadian arm
2 CONC y launched Operation SPRING, the first stage of the drive to Falaise. O
2 CONC n July 25, the Battalion moved to an assembly area along a railway embank
2 CONC ment prior to the attack on La Hague. Before the attack could be launche
2 CONC d the troops had to wait for the North Nova Scotia Highlanders to take Ti
2 CONC lly-la-Campagne. Although the railway embankment offered some protection
2 CONC , the Battalion suffered many casualties from the constant German artille
2 CONC ry, and from bombing and strafing missions from the Luftwaffe. The Nort
2 CONC h Nova Scotia Highlanders punched into Tilly, but were pushed back and fo
2 CONC rced to withdraw through the Battalion lines. The Germans then began conc
2 CONC entrating tanks from Fontenay-le-Marmion and moving them to La Hague. Bec
2 CONC ause of this build up of armour the Battalion's attack on La Hague was ca
2 CONC lled off. During the waiting period in this area, the Battalion suffere
2 CONC d three more fatalities.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Given the change in plans, the Battalion was tasked to hold its presen
2 CONC t position and to prepare for an attack on Tilly in three or four days ti
2 CONC me. The Battalion was to keep up the pressure on the German forces and pr
2 CONC event them from withdrawing so they could be used against British and Ame
2 CONC rican forces to the west. During these days, Allied armoured advances wer
2 CONC e being made in other areas along the front. Consequently, the Battalio
2 CONC n was forced to hang onto the positions at the embankment for several mor
2 CONC e days. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT At midnight, on July 30, and throughout the early hours of the next morn
2 CONC ing, while German aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the area for thei
2 CONC r artillery, the Battalion pulled back through Vaucelles, over the Orne t
2 CONC o Caen. They eventually reached the Orchards of Colomby where they were g
2 CONC iven a rest period. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Since June 6, the Battalion had been continuously in action over a perio
2 CONC d of 55 days. From D-Day it had suffered a total of 678 casualties, inclu
2 CONC ding 185 killed and eight missing in action. The Battalion sustained an a
2 CONC dditional fatality during its withdrawal to Colomby. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Since D-Day the Battalion doctors had done a remarkable job under the mo
2 CONC st difficult conditions. Battalion medical officers who were general prac
2 CONC titioners often had to become surgeons because it was not possible to wai
2 CONC t until ambulances took the wounded to field hospitals. Captain W.S. Huck
2 CONC vale, who landed with Battalion Headquarters on D-Day, treated hundreds o
2 CONC f Canadian and German soldiers as well as French civilians. In July 194
2 CONC 4 he suffered a severe head wound and was evacuated to Canada. Doctor Huc
2 CONC kvale was awarded the Military Cross. He was succeeded by Doctor Harry Di
2 CONC ckson. As well, the medical staff and stretcher-bearers under Sergeant Al
2 CONC f Allen performed valiantly under trying conditions. Allen was also a mem
2 CONC ber of the Battalion band.
2 CONT 
2 CONT While the Battalion was regrouping, the men from the unit who had been s
2 CONC lightly wounded in previous engagements now returned as reinforcements. W
2 CONC hile at Colomby the Battalion played sports, went to the movies, splashe
2 CONC d in the mobile baths, and lazed on the beaches. There were excursions ba
2 CONC ck to the scene of the D-Day assault and visits to the graves of friend
2 CONC s who had fallen there. While the Battalion was at rest in Colomby, the t
2 CONC roops were treated to the Canadian Army Show staged by the Legion Auxilia
2 CONC ry War Services in the "Windmill Theatre," a cavern in the quarries of Fo
2 CONC ntaine-Henry that could seat over a thousand people. The Battalion was al
2 CONC so visited by Lieutenant General Simonds and Major General Keller, and b
2 CONC y the war correspondents, J.A.M. Cook, who covered the Regina Rifles fo
2 CONC r the Leader Post, and Gregory Clark. It was here that the officers of th
2 CONC e Battalion true to their old tradition held their first formal mess dinn
2 CONC er of the war on the Continent.

2 NOTE Dees Eulogy  8 April 2000 
3 CONT First I would like to thank all of you who are here today to say good b
3 CONC y to Dee Corbett, a mother, grandmother, great-grandmother aunt and frien
3 CONC d.  We very much appreciate your being with us today to share in our los
3 CONC s and to celebrate her wonderful and long life. 
3 CONT Moms life spanned a little more than 88 years and throughout that tim
3 CONC e she met lifes challenges with a positive approach and, of course the r
3 CONC ight hat.   She liked her hats and we thought they suited her well.  And
3 CONC . those hats also were sometimes practical.  Last Christmas. 
3 CONT Mom enjoyed a happy youth growing up in Shawinigan -  the only girl in t
3 CONC he family and the apple of her fathers eye.   Her education at the Ursul
3 CONC ine convent laid the foundation for her strong faith that served her wel
3 CONC l throughout her life.  It was her habit to say her prayers before the en
3 CONC d of each day and at the time of her death, she still had her Ursuline pr
3 CONC ayer book by her side.   Even as a young woman she enjoyed community invo
3 CONC lvement and was quite proud of her time as one of the first senior girl-g
3 CONC uide leaders.  She also played tennis and was a good piano player. 
3 CONT Mom married in 1939, just before dad went overseas.  On the whole, Dad w
3 CONC as gone for six years but he returned home twice, once in 1941 and agai
3 CONC n in 1942.  Ross, Stuart & I were born in those war years - but that wa
3 CONC s a difficult way to start a marriage and family.  She lived with her Da
3 CONC d in Shawinigan during that time and though he was a tremendous support
3 CONC , Im sure she said many prayers for the safe return of her loving husban
3 CONC d and the father of her three sons.  They were blessed. Dad did return. A
3 CONC nd, they moved back to Quebec City to resume their lives together.  Keit
3 CONC h was born in 1949  so now they had four sons.  Though the war years wer
3 CONC e difficult, it provided Mom and Dad with new, life-long friends around w
3 CONC hich much of my parents social life in Quebec City was centered.  It als
3 CONC o provided Mom with a survival capability that held her in good stead whe
3 CONC n dad passed away prematurely in 1965 and she had to go it alone. 
3 CONT She would advocate that the secret of survival is to keep busy.  She com
3 CONC bined her social and other skills to make a new and productive life for h
3 CONC erself when she moved to Montreal in 1969 where Ross, Stuart and I were w
3 CONC orking and where Keith, the #4 son, was studying at Loyola.  She was ver
3 CONC y fortunate, I think, to settle here in St Richards Parish, Cote St Luc
3 CONC .   She loved contributing to organizing the Church Bazaars and working w
3 CONC ith handicapped children.  She also spoke very highly of the camaraderi
3 CONC e in her bridge group and delighted in the friendship and artistic endeav
3 CONC ors of the St Patricks Art group.  She made a lot of new and wonderful f
3 CONC riends here in Montreal and maintained her lifelong friends that she ha
3 CONC d in Quebec City. 
3 CONT Family also kept Mom busy.  For one thing, she never forgot any of her s
3 CONC ons birthdays or anniversaries or that of her daughters-in-law, grandchi
3 CONC ldren or great-grandchildren.  And she was always ready for a celebratio
3 CONC n  of which we had many- and she was always ready to help. 
3 CONT  I would be remiss not to tell you a little about Moms dying.  Mom wa
3 CONC s blessed with 88 good years but the last seven weeks of her life weren
3 CONC t what any of us would have wished for her.  Faced with renal failure an
3 CONC d a strong desire to live, Mom opted to undergo dialysis treatment  dete
3 CONC rmined that her mental strength and faith in God would see her recove
3 CONC r  as she had so many times in the past.  While her blood was being trea
3 CONC ted, she grew weaker instead of stronger and her leg with the damaged cir
3 CONC culatory problem got worse.  After 5 weeks at St Marys Hospital and whil
3 CONC e the doctors were contemplating the next procedure to save her leg, Mo
3 CONC m decided, after consulting with Father Peter, to make sure that this wa
3 CONC s not a sin against God, that she should stop treatment and give hersel
3 CONC f back to God.  After 12 more days, she died peacefully. 
3 CONT Throughout her hospital stay she had her family around her and she was a
3 CONC ble to say goodbye to many family and friends who either visited or phone
3 CONC d.  Mom greatly appreciated this attention and it helped her very much
3 CONC .  In watching my mother go through the dying process, we were witnesse
3 CONC s to the power that faith provides at times like these.  About a week bef
3 CONC ore she died, a nun told Mom that God chooses those he loves to share Hi
3 CONC s pain so He must love her very much. 
3 CONT As sad as Mom was to leave us and as difficult as this relatively shor
3 CONC t illness was, she never complained about her illness or her pain.  Her s
3 CONC trength and sense of humor showed throughout the ordeal and she gained th
3 CONC e respect of her new friends at St Marys Hospital. 
3 CONT My brothers and I would agree that God gave us a great mother and now h
3 CONC e has taken her back - to be with my father and brother Ross and with he
3 CONC r latest great-grandchild Kathryn.   Mom said that she was going to see
3 CONC k out a lot of her loved ones when she got to heaven.  In life, Mom was s
3 CONC uccessful in achieving most things that she set out to do.   She did regr
3 CONC et that she couldnt stay longer  for she loved life and she loved her f
3 CONC amily and her friends.  But, as she told Maria her granddaughter on the p
3 CONC hone a few days before she died,  God is calling me  its time for me t
3 CONC o go. 
3 CONT So, bye for now Mom and please keep an eye out for us until we are toge
3 CONC ther again.   We will miss you greatly. 
3 CONT By Bruce Corbett for his mothers funeral Mass on 8 April 2000.

1 RELI Roman Catholic. During the rebellion of 1798, his mother was being chase
2 CONC d by English soldiers for the purpose of obtaining information as to th
2 CONC e whereabouts of the Irish rebels of the family. In order to escape, sh
2 CONC e attempted to cross a stream or river, and holding the infant above he
2 CONC r head, succeeded in crossing even though, at its most dangerous point, t
2 CONC he water covered her shoulders, through what she considered to be a mirac
2 CONC le. She determined that this infant son should become a priest, if that b
2 CONC e the will of God. Apparently it was.

1 NOTE L'Honorable AUGUSTIN NORBERT MORIN
2 CONT (1803-1865)
2 CONT par
2 CONT M. LAbbé Elie-J. AUCLAIR
2 CONT 
2 CONT Nous avons eu deux Morin dans la vie publique au Canada : Augustin Norbe
2 CONC rt, qui fut premier ministre sous l'Union, et Louis Siméon, de vingt an
2 CONC s plus jeune, qui fut aussi ministre avant la Confédération. Ils étaien
2 CONC t de familles différentes et sans proche parenté entre eux. Il s'agit ic
2 CONC i du premier des deux.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Augustin Norbert Morin naquit, le 13 octobre 1803, à Saint Michel de Bel
2 CONC lechasse, d'une brave famille de cultivateurs, qui compta onze enfants do
2 CONC nt il était l'aîné. Son ancêtre à la septième génération, Pierre Morin, e
2 CONC st signalé à Port Royal, en Acadie, dans le recensement de 1671. Son père
2 CONC , Augustin Morin, marié en 1802 à Marie Colin Dugal, continuait à Saint M
2 CONC ichel la tradition terrienne de ses anciens et il jouissait d'une certain
2 CONC e aisance. Distingué, à cause de ses talents brillants, par son curé l'ab
2 CONC bé McGuire, Augustin-Norbert, comme aussi François l'un de ses frères cad
2 CONC ets, qui devint prêtre, fut envoyé au séminaire de Québec pour y faire se
2 CONC s études. Condisciple d'Etienne Parent, il lui disputa les premiers pri
2 CONC x de leur classe. C'est à Québec également que le jeune Morin commença e
2 CONC n 1824 son cours de droit. Il vint le terminer à Montréal, au bureau de D
2 CONC enis Benjamin Viger, où il passa deux ans, et, en 1828, il était admis a
2 CONC u barreau.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Comme Lafontaine, Morin débuta jeune sur la scène publique. Sa lettre a
2 CONC u juge Bowen, de novembre 1825, qu'il signait Un étudiant en droit, et da
2 CONC ns laquelle il revendiquait vigoureusement les droits de la langue frança
2 CONC ise, est restée fameuse. Elle le fit connaître et attira sur lui l'attent
2 CONC ion, car l'anonymat en fut vite percé. En 1826, alors qu'il était encor
2 CONC e étudiant, Duvernay et Viger, en fondant La Minerve, le choisirent pou
2 CONC r en être l'un des principaux rédacteurs. Le 26 octobre 1830, à 27 ans, l
2 CONC a même année que Lafontaine, il était élu député à la Chambre de Québec
2 CONC . Tandis que Lafontaine représentait Terrebonne, Morin, lui, était l'él
2 CONC u de Bellechasse.
2 CONT 
2 CONT C'est Morin qui rédigea, en 1831, à la demande de Papineau et de ses ami
2 CONC s et adhérents, le célèbre document dit des 92 résolutions. Ce document
2 CONC , qui condensait les griefs des Canadiens, ayant été approuvé par tous le
2 CONC s députés nationaux du temps, Morin fut chargé en 1834 d'aller les présen
2 CONC ter aux autorités de Londres, où, avec Viger, délégué du Bas Canada, il s
2 CONC outint les droits de ses compatriotes, sans grand succès pour le moment
2 CONC . Revenu au pays, il fut activement mêlé, comme lieutenant de Papinea
2 CONC u à Québec, au mouvement qui devait aboutir, contre son gré, car il ne fu
2 CONC t jamais partisan de la violence, aux "troubles" de 1837. Désigné comme s
2 CONC uspect en 1838, il dut se cacher dans les bois pour éviter la prison. I
2 CONC l reparut à Québec au départ de Colborne en octobre 1839. Comme Lafontain
2 CONC e, il demanda en vain qu'on lui fît son procès.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Sous l'Union, Morin fut député de Nicolet d'avril 1841 à janvier 1842. N
2 CONC ommé juge à Kamouraska, ce 1er janvier 1842, il démissionna pour entrer d
2 CONC ans le premier ministère Lafontaine Baldwin en 1843. Il se fit d'abord él
2 CONC ire député de Saguenay. Aux élections de novembre 1844, ce sont ses ancie
2 CONC ns électeurs de Bellechasse qui le choisirent comme député. Lafontaine e
2 CONC t Baldwin ayant repris le pouvoir en 1848, après quelques années dans l'o
2 CONC pposition, Morin fut élu président de la Chambre. C'était sous lord Elgi
2 CONC n (1847 1854). Morin présidait la séance du Parlement à Montréal, en 1849
2 CONC , quand, pour protester contre le "bill" des indemnités, les torys miren
2 CONC t le feu aux édifices parlementaires. Stoïque à la façon d'un sénateur ro
2 CONC main, il attendit pour lever la séance qu'on proposât une motion d'ajourn
2 CONC ement. Il aurait brûlé sur place, a écrit L. O. David, plutôt que de manq
2 CONC uer à l'ordre.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Lafontaine ayant démissionné en 1851, pour être nommé juge deux ans plu
2 CONC s tard, Morin le remplaça à la tête du parti pour le Bas Canada, et, au
2 CONC x élections de décembre, il fut élu, à son tour, député de Terrebonne. C'
2 CONC est alors qu'il forma avec M. Hincks, du Haut Canada, le ministère qui po
2 CONC rte leur nom devant l'histoire. En juin 1854, ce ministère Hincks Morin é
2 CONC tait renversé, et, aux élections qui suivirent, Morin fut défait dans Ter
2 CONC rebonne. Elu peu après dans Chicoutimi, il forma avec M. McNab, chef de
2 CONC s conservateurs du Haut Canada, un gouvernement de coalition. C'est ce mi
2 CONC nistère McNab Morin qui marque dans l'histoire la naissance du parti libé
2 CONC ral conservateur. A la fin de la session de 1855, Morin fut nommé juge d
2 CONC e la cour supérieure. Quatre ans plus tard. en 1859, il était chargé, ave
2 CONC c les juges Day et Caron, de la codification des lois du Bas Canada, mesu
2 CONC re rendue nécessaire surtout par l'abrogation des droits seigneuriaux e
2 CONC t l'abolition de l'ancien système féodal. Ses dernières années, il les oc
2 CONC cupa dans ce labeur ardu et délicat de la codification de nos lois. Entr
2 CONC e temps, et depuis 1842 environ, il s'intéressait à luvre de la colonis
2 CONC ation, et c'est lui qui fonda Sainte-Adèle, au nord de Montréal. Il venai
2 CONC t à peine de terminer son travail de codification et de le voir sanctionn
2 CONC é par une mesure du gouvernement quand il mourut subitement, à Sainte Adè
2 CONC le le 27 juillet 1865, à 62 ans. Ses restes mortels furent inhumés à Sain
2 CONC t Hyacinthe.
2 CONT 
2 CONT En 1843, Morin, alors juge, avait épousé, à Saint Hyacinthe, Adèle Raymo
2 CONC nd, la sur de Mgr Raymond, supérieur du séminaire de cette ville. Il n'e
2 CONC ut pas d'enfants de ce mariage, et, par conséquent, comme Lafontaine, i
2 CONC l n'a pas laissé de postérité. "M. Morin, écrivait L. O. David en 1870, a
2 CONC vait la taille haute et courbée. Tout dans son extérieur, ses manières e
2 CONC t sa physionomie, respirait la modestie, la bonté et la douceur. Dans se
2 CONC s campagnes politiques, il avait plutôt l'air d'un évêque en visite pasto
2 CONC rale que d'un candidat en quête d'un comté. Il parlait avec la simplicit
2 CONC é du bon curé de village qui fait le prône à ses paroissiens depuis ving
2 CONC t cinq ans. La vie a été pour lui comme une mission, un sacrifice continu
2 CONC el et un enchaînement de bonnes actions. Servir Dieu, son pays et ses con
2 CONC citoyens, fut l'unique objet de ses aspirations, de ses efforts et de se
2 CONC s travaux . . ."
2 CONT 
2 CONT Appréciant son oeuvre de colonisateur dans le nord de Montréal, M. l'abb
2 CONC é Edmond Langevin-Lacroix, dans son Histoire de Sainte Adèle (1927), écri
2 CONC t de même : "Sans doute, M. Morin ne demeura pas habituellement dans no
2 CONC s montagnes. Mais il y revenait aussi souvent que ses fonctions d'homme p
2 CONC ublic le lui permettaient . . . Le passage du grand homme, colon enthousi
2 CONC aste, était un encouragement pour tous. De fait, très au courant de la vi
2 CONC e pénible de nos braves gens, il aidait tout le monde. Bien qu'il fût pau
2 CONC vre lui même, sa charité l'empêchant de devenir riche, chacun avait des r
2 CONC edevances à lui solder. En venant vers le nord, il disait parfois qu'il a
2 CONC llait percevoir ses dus. Mais, le plus souvent, désarmé devant la misère
2 CONC , il vidait ses poches et empruntait pour s'en retourner . . ."
2 CONT 
2 CONT On cite de nombreux traits qui le peignent sur le vif, homme de bon cur
2 CONC , toujours généreux et charitable. En voici quelques-uns. Un jour qu'il é
2 CONC tait très occupé, un mendiant se présente qui venait très souvent à son b
2 CONC ureau. "Dites donc, mon ami, échappa M. Morin, vous n'êtes pas raisonnabl
2 CONC e. . ." Mais, l'autre n'était pas sorti du bureau que le grave ministre c
2 CONC ourait après lui pour s'excuser. Une autre fois, un colon, qui lui devai
2 CONC t une somme assez rondelette et avait reçu une lettre sévère de son agen
2 CONC t d'avoir à régler, se présente à M. Morin, s'excuse de ses retards, parl
2 CONC e de ses misères, de sa pauvreté, de sa nombreuse famille. . . "Oui, oui
2 CONC , mon ami, je comprends, dit aussitôt M. Morin, vous avez beaucoup à souf
2 CONC frir. Tenez, prenez ces cinq piastres, ça vous aidera." Chauveau à qui M
2 CONC . Morin avait promis de placer quelqu'un, le rencontre sur la rue. Aussit
2 CONC ôt, Morin s'excuse de n'avoir pas encore rempli sa promesse. "Je vais m'e
2 CONC n occuper, dit il, comme de moi même." "Gardez vous en bien, reprend Chau
2 CONC veau, traitez le plutôt comme s'il était votre ennemi juré, je suis sûr q
2 CONC u'il sera bien placé." Jolie boutade qui montre fort justement ce qu'étai
2 CONC t Morin. Quand Morin fut nommé juge à Kamouraska, le 1er janvier 1842, i
2 CONC l se rendit tout de suite, le dimanche suivant, faire visite aux sien
2 CONC s à Saint Michel de Bellechasse. Il arriva devant l'église de la paroisse
2 CONC , à l'heure de la grand'messe, au moment où les gens allaient y entrer. I
2 CONC l avait alors 39 ans et il était déjà un personnage, ancien ministre et n
2 CONC ouveau juge. Mais, il avait le culte des bonnes vieilles traditions. Aper
2 CONC cevant son père, au milieu de la foule, il va vers lui, se découvre, se m
2 CONC et à genoux dans la neige et lui demande tout simplement sa bénédiction d
2 CONC u jour de l'an. Ce détail est typique.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Quand Morin mourut en juillet 1865, Chauveau qui l'avait beaucoup pratiq
2 CONC ué et bien connu, écrivit cette note de louange, que je me plais à rappel
2 CONC er pour finir ma modeste notice : "Il y a eu peu d'hommes en ce pays plu
2 CONC s curieux de s'instruire et plus instruits sur toutes sortes de sujets qu
2 CONC e M. Morin, et, certainement, il n'y a jamais eu d'hommes publics aussi r
2 CONC emplis de désintéressement et d'abnégation, de bienveillance et d'urbanit
2 CONC é, de modestie et d'humilité. Il poussait même la modestie et l'humilit
2 CONC é jusqu'à l'excès, et ces qualités l'emportaient, chez lui, quand il s'ag
2 CONC issait de se juger lui même, sur son jugement par ailleurs si juste et s
2 CONC i fin. Il s'est occupé activement et avec succès toujours d'une immense v
2 CONC ariété de sujets. Droit romain et droit moderne, théologie et droit ecclé
2 CONC siastique, sciences, agriculture, instruction publique, littérature, lang
2 CONC ues anciennes et langues modernes, finances et statistiques, rien ne semb
2 CONC lait être au dessus, ni au dessous, de ses recherches, de son ambition d
2 CONC e savoir et d'agir, et, en somme, de faire le bien, ce qui a été l'uniqu
2 CONC e but de toutes ses pensées."

2 NOTE Stephen Hopkins was one of only a few passengers on the Mayflower to hav
3 CONC e made a prior trip to America. He came in 1609 on the Sea Venture heade
3 CONC d for Jamestown, Virginia. But instead, they were marooned on an island
3 CONC , where the 150 passengers were stranded for nine months. Hopkins led a
3 CONC n uprising ,challenging the governor's authority, and was sentenced to de
3 CONC ath. But he begged and moaned about the ruin of his wife, and so was pard
3 CONC oned. The company built two vessels and escaped the island.
3 CONT After spending two years in Jamestown, Hopkins returned to England. Step
3 CONC hen Hopkins brought with him on the Mayflower his wife Elizabeth, childre
3 CONC n Giles and onstance by his first marriage, and Damaris by his second mar
3 CONC riage. A son Oceanus was born while the Mayflower was at sea. Stephen par
3 CONC ticipated in the early exploring missions and was an "ambassador" along w
3 CONC ith Myles Standish for early Indian relations. In 1636, Hopkins was fine
3 CONC d for the battery of John Tisdale, in 1637 he was found guilty of allowin
3 CONC g men to drink on a Sunday at his house, and in 1638 he was fined for no
3 CONC t dealing fairly with an apprentice-girl, Dorothy Temple. He was also cha
3 CONC rged with several other minor crimes, including selling glass at too hig
3 CONC h a price, selling illegal intoxicants, and allowing men to get drunk a
3 CONC t his house. However, this in no way indicated he was disloyal to the Col
3 CONC ony--in fact he was a prominent member, Assistant governor from about 163
3 CONC 3 until 1636, and he volunteered to fight in the Pequot War of 1637.

2 CONC . On part quand même mais, moins d'une demi-heure plus tard, la petite tr

2 CONC ; Couture tire à son tour et tue son adversaire.Les quatre autres le capt
2 CONC urent et, comme le mort était leur chef, Couture connaît pour la premièr
2 CONC e fois la vengeance indienne. On lui arrache les ongles, on lui brise le
2 CONC s jointures puis on lui perce lentement la paume des mains. Un doigt es

2 CONC oin de là ses compagnons en font autant.Les prisonniers qui n'ont pas ét
2 CONC é tués sur-le-champ sont emmenés aux villages agniers où d'autres torture
2 CONC s les attendent. Tous sont mis à nu et doivent passer entre deux rangée

2 CONT Couture est abandonné, selon la coutume, à la famille du chef qu'il a tu
2 CONC é, pour qu'elle dispose de lui comme elle l'entendra. On le fait assiste

2 CONC , qui panse ses blessures et le traite bien. II confessera par la suit
2 CONC e à Jogues que, malgré les propositions qui lui ont été faites, il est re
2 CONC sté fidèle à ses voeux de donné. Le 29 septembre 1642, Goupil est assassi
2 CONC né. Jogues réussit à s'évader en novembre 1643, avec la complicité des Ho

2 CONC t décide d'attendre une autre occasion. II continue de se perfectionner d
2 CONC ans la langue iroquoise, d'observer les moeurs, et surtout tente de perce
2 CONC r les intentions des chefs. II s'adapte bien à son nouveau genre de vie
2 CONC . Son attitude pacifique le met en confiance auprès des membres du consei
2 CONC l. Une Relation mentionne que "les Iroquois le tenaient parmi eux en esti
2 CONC me et réputation comme un des premiers de leur nation. Aussi tranchait-i
2 CONC l parmi eux du capitaine, s'étant acquis ce crédit par sa prudence et pa

2 CONT Ainsi, en juillet 1645, il accompagne le grand chef Kiotseaeton, diploma
2 CONC te attitré de la tribu des Agniers, à un conseil tenu à Trois-Rivières pa
2 CONC r le gouverneur général Huault de Montmagny et François de Champflour*, c

2 CONT C'est bien dans un désir sincère de paix que les Agniers ramènent leur p

2 CONC suites, découvreur, interprète, diplomate, juge sénéchal, premier colon d
2 CONC e Lévis, né vers 1616 à Saint-Godard-de-Rouen (Normandie), fils de Guilla
2 CONC ume Couture et de Madeleine Mallet, décédé en 1701.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Il est impossible, daprès les documents connus, de fixer lanné
2 CONC e de son arrivée en Nouvelle-France. Les Jésuites qui, dans leurs Relatio
2 CONC ns, ne tarissent pas déloges sur son dévouement et son courage, ne fourn
2 CONC issent aucun indice sur ce point. Les années 1639 et 1640 semblent les pl
2 CONC us probables. Il peut avoir fait la traversée en même temps que René Goup
2 CONC il* et le père René Ménard*, au printemps de 1640, et sêtre engagé comm
2 CONC e aide des Jésuites avant son départ de France. Sa vocation de « donn
2 CONC é » peut lui avoir été inspiree par Goupil, qui létait déjà. Dans un act
2 CONC e du 26 juin 1641, signé à Québec, dans lequel il lègue à sa mère et à s
2 CONC a sur les quelques biens immeubles que son père lui avait laissés en Fra
2 CONC nce, Couture se qualifie « domestique des révérends pères religieux de l
2 CONC a Compagnie de Jésus de la mission des Hurons en la Nouvelle-France ». I
2 CONC l part peu après pour la Huronie, apportant divers effets pour les missio
2 CONC nnaires. Cest la première de ses grandes randonnées. Il revient à Québe
2 CONC c le printemps suivant, avec les pères Isaac Jogues* et Charles Raymbaut*
2 CONC , ce dernier gravement malade ; quelques chefs indiens, dont le célèbre A
2 CONC hatsistari*, les accompagnent : en tout 25 voyageurs en 4 canots.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Quinze jours à peine après leur arrivée, Jogues et Couture, accomp
2 CONC agnés cette fois de René Goupil, appareillent à nouveau pour le pays de
2 CONC s Hurons. Il sagit dune expédition denvergure, car les chefs indiens
2 CONC , venus à Québec en mission officielle, retournent en même temps queux d
2 CONC ans leur pays, assurés de la protection des autorités françaises contre l
2 CONC eurs ennemis iroquois. Le 1er août 1642, 12 canots, portant une quarantai
2 CONC ne de personnes, quittent Trois-Rivières. Le départ néchappe pas à li
2 CONC l vigilant des sentinelles ennemies. Le premier soir du départ, à peine a
2 CONC rrivé à lentrée des Îles-du-Sud du lac Saint-Pierre, le convoi fait halt
2 CONC e pour la nuit [V. Ahatsistari]. Le lendemain, à la pointe du jour, on v
2 CONC a se mettre en route quand des éclaireurs décèlent sur la rive des piste

2 CONC te à Jogues que, malgré les propositions qui lui ont été faites, il est r
2 CONC esté fidèle à ses vux de donné.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Le 29 septembre 1642, Goupil est assassiné. Jogues réussit à séva
2 CONC der en novembre 1643, avec la complicité des Hollandais voisins, et à se
2 CONC mbarquer pour la France. Guillaume pourrait se joindre à lui, mais il n
2 CONC e veut pas compromettre la fuite du missionnaire et décide dattendre un
2 CONC e autre occasion. Il continue de se perfectionner dans la langue iroquois
2 CONC e, dobserver les murs, et surtout tente de percer les intentions des ch

2 CONC e le met en confiance auprès des membres du conseil. Une Relation mention
2 CONC ne que « les Iroquois le tenaient parmi eux en estime et réputation comm

2 CONC omme plusieurs de ses successeurs [...], il sélèvera chez ce singulier p
2 CONC euple de létat de prisonnier à celui de chef ».
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Ainsi, en juillet 1645, il accompagne le grand chef Kiotseaeton*
2 CONC , diplomate attitré de la. tribu des Agniers, à un conseil tenu à Trois-R
2 CONC ivières par le gouverneur général Huault* de Montmagny et François de Cha

2 CONC , comme ses compagnons. Il sidentifie, mais tous, y compris le père Jogu
2 CONC es revenu de France depuis quelque temps, hésitent à le reconnaître, ca
2 CONC r on a perdu tout espoir de le revoir. « Si-toit quil fut reconnu, not
2 CONC e la Relation de 1645, chacun se jetta à son col, on le regardoit comme u
2 CONC n homme ressuscité qui donne de la joye à tous ceux qui le croyoient mort
2 CONC , ou du moins en danger de passer le reste de ses jours dans une tres-ame
2 CONC re et tres-barbare captivité ».
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Cest bien dans un désir sincère de paix que les Agniers ramènen
2 CONC t leur précieux prisonnier, car Couture les a convaincus des intentions s
2 CONC ympathiques des Français. Mais lidée de ce dernier va encore plus loi
2 CONC n ; il voudrait être linstigateur dune paix définitive entre toutes le
2 CONC s nations indiennes et la colonie française. Dans ce but, il accepte de r
2 CONC etourner avec les ambassadeurs iroquois pour les encourager à entamer de
2 CONC s négociations sérieuses de paix avec les Hurons.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Revenu au printemps de 1646 de son ambassade chez les Agniers, Gui
2 CONC llaume sollicite des Jésuites lautorisation de rompre ses vux de « donn
2 CONC é », car il a lintention de se marier : peut-être désire-t-il épouser un
2 CONC e Iroquoise en vue de renforcer lalliance entre les Indiens et les Blanc
2 CONC s. Le supérieur Jérôme Lalemant* donne son consentement le 26 avril. Cout
2 CONC ure poursuit à Trois-Rivières et à Québec ses pourparlers de paix avec le
2 CONC s chefs des diverses nations. Il est sur le point de réussir lorsque le p
2 CONC ère Jogues, qui en est à son deuxième séjour chez les Agniers depuis so
2 CONC n évasion, et son compagnon Jean de La Lande* sont assassinés, le 18 octo
2 CONC bre 1646. Les négociations sont rompues. Les Algonquins et les Hurons se
2 CONC n réjouissent secrètement car ils vont conserver seuls lamitié des Franç
2 CONC ais. Couture, nullement découragé, se rend chez les Hurons en 1647 pour t
2 CONC âcher de renouer les traités dalliance. Ses efforts sont vains, mais à s
2 CONC on retour la population trifluvienne et les Indiens fidèles lui font fête
2 CONC , inspirés par le père Jacques Buteux* qui lestime hautement et qui, dan
2 CONC s un mémoire de 1652, lappelle « le bon Couture ». Une semblable fête lu
2 CONC i est réservée à Sillery, « avec la joie de tous les sauvages hurons, alg
2 CONC onquins et anniéronons [Agniers ] », note le Journal des Jésuites.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En cette même année 1647, Couture sassocie à François Byssot* d
2 CONC e La Rivière et va sétablir à Pointe-Lévy, en la seigneurie de Lauson. I
2 CONC l accepte de défricher un terrain et de bâtir pour son associé un corps d
2 CONC e logis, ce dernier fournissant largent et les matériaux. À lautomne, l
2 CONC a bâtisse est terminée ; Byssot donne 200ª à Couture pour son travail, e
2 CONC t lui permet de rester dans le logis jusquà ce quil ait terminé, sur u
2 CONC n terrain voisin, sa propre maison. Le 15 octobre 1648, tous deux obtienn
2 CONC ent du seigneur Jean de Lauson* leur titre officiel de concession. Le 1
2 CONC 8 novembre 1649, Couture épouse Anne, une des trois surs Esmard, venue
2 CONC s ensemble de Niort, en Poitou : Barbe épousa Olivier Letardif* et Madele
2 CONC ine, Zacharie, le fils de Zacharie Cloutier*. La cérémonie du mariage, pr
2 CONC ésidée par labbé Le Sueur*, a lieu « en la maison du dit sieur Coutur
2 CONC e à la pointe de Lévi », dit le registre de catholicité de Québec.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Bien que Couture soit désireux de rester tranquille sur son bien e
2 CONC t de le faire fructifier, sa connaissance des langues indiennes et son ex
2 CONC périence de la vie des bois sont souvent mises à profit par les autorités
2 CONC . On ne peut douter quil ait fortement inspiré le père Buteux dans la pa
2 CONC rtie de la relation détaillée que ce religieux fit de la captivité du pèr
2 CONC e Jogues. À part quelques Hurons, il en fut le seul témoin. En 1657, il e
2 CONC st réclamé comme interprète pour létablissement dune mission chez les O
2 CONC nontagués, mission que cette tribu a elle-même réclamée. En 1661, Coutur
2 CONC e accepte de participer avec les pères Gabriel Druillettes* et Claude Dab
2 CONC lon*, Denis Guyon et François Pelletier, à une expédition envoyée par l
2 CONC e gouverneur Voyer dArgenson à la découverte de la mer du Nord. Les guid
2 CONC es indiens, redoutant la présence dIroquois dans les parages, abandonnen
2 CONC t les Français à la ligne de partage des eaux. Deux ans plus tard, il acc
2 CONC epte la proposition du gouverneur Dubois* Davaugour de prendre le command
2 CONC ement dune expédition pour accompagner « les Sauvages du côté du nord ju
2 CONC sques et si longtemps quil le jugera à propos pour le service du Roy e
2 CONC t le bien du pays : et pourra aller ou envoyer hyverner avec eux, si
2 CONC l y trouve sa sûreté et quelque avantage pour le bien public ». Il sagi
2 CONC t dune expédition denvergure : trouver une route intérieure vers la me
2 CONC r du Nord. Deux Français, Pierre Duquet*, plus tard notaire, et Jean Lang
2 CONC lois, charpentier de navires, accompagnent Couture ; les autres sont de
2 CONC s Indiens : en tout 44 canots. Dans une déclaration assermentée quil fi
2 CONC t en 1688, Couture retrace litinéraire suivi : le groupe part à la mi-ma
2 CONC i de Québec, sengage dans la rivière Saguenay, arrive au lac Mistassin
2 CONC i le 26 juin. Une tempête soudaine laîsse un pied de neige. Le groupe con
2 CONC tinue sa route, arrive à une rivière [Rupert] « qui se décharge dans la m
2 CONC er du Nord ». Les Français ne peuvent poursuivre leur route, car les guid
2 CONC es indiens ne veulent pas aller plus loin. Couture laffiirme en 1688 : i
2 CONC l na pu, en 1663, se rendre à la mer du Nord. Tout de même cette témérai
2 CONC re expédition lui a permis de connaître la vaste région au nord du Saint-
2 CONC Laurent, peuplée de tribus indiennes de murs bien différentes et plus pa
2 CONC cifiques que les Iroquois et les Hurons. En 1665 il sentend avec Charle
2 CONC s Amiot*, Noël Jérémie* et Sébastien Prouvereau, pour accompagner le pèr
2 CONC e Henri Nouvel qui va évangéliser les Papinachois. Lannée suivante, il e
2 CONC st délégué par le gouverneur en Nouvelle-Hollande pour protester contre l
2 CONC e meurtre de deux officiers français par les Agniers. Il se rend chez le
2 CONC s Iroquois et les somme de livrer les meurtriers, les menaçant dune expé
2 CONC dition punitive. Il revient à Québec le 6 septembre avec deux Agniers, do
2 CONC nt lun était le chef du groupe qui avait tué le lieutenant Chazy.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Cet épisode marque la fin de la carrière aventureuse de Guillaum
2 CONC e Couture. Par la suite il ne quitte guère son domaine de la Pointe-Lévy
2 CONC . Le recensement de 1667 ly situe, avec sa femme et 9 enfants. Il a 20 a
2 CONC rpents en culture et 6 bêtes à cornes. Il exerce tour à tour ou cumule le
2 CONC s charges les plus importantes de la seigneurie : capitaine de milice, gr
2 CONC effier, « juge sénéchal de la côte de Lauzon ». Selon un acte de Nicola
2 CONC s Métru du 16 novembre 1684, il aurait fait aussi office de notaire. En 1
2 CONC 675 il sollicite pour la seigneurie, où les censitaires commencent à êtr
2 CONC e nombreux, un curé résident. Il ne lobtiendra quen 1690, étant donné l
2 CONC a rareté de prêtres. Par ces différentes sources, on sent quil est lâm
2 CONC e de la seigneurie naissante. Pourtant, au recensement de 1681, il ne s
2 CONC e donnait que lhumble titre de menuisier.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       On ne peut que paraphraser sur les dernières années de sa vie, qu
2 CONC i furent celles dun colon ordinaire des premiers temps. Lattaque de Qué
2 CONC bec par Phips* en 1690 mit les habitants de la rive sud sur un pied dale
2 CONC rte. Il est probable que lancien héros ne sen désintéressa pas, mais o
2 CONC n ne possède aucun détail précis sur sa participation aux projets de défe
2 CONC nse. Les archives du Conseil souverain ont conservé les détails de mésent
2 CONC entes survenues parfois entre Couture et Byssot, dautres fois entre le
2 CONC s deux pionniers et les autres censitaires de la seigneurie. Lanalyse d
2 CONC e ces documents démontre que Couture ne semblait pas dun caractère commo
2 CONC de et quil entendait faire reconnaître ses droits. Selon ces mêmes docum
2 CONC ents, il paraît avoir outrepassé ses prérogatives de juge et de capitain
2 CONC e de la seigneurie. Malgré tout, il est appelé à quelques reprises à siég
2 CONC er au Conseil souverain en raison de labsence des membres réguliers. Ent
2 CONC re-temps, la plupart de ses dix enfants se sont alliés à des gens de bonn
2 CONC e lignée. Ainsi, Marie épousa en 1678 François Vézier, et Claude Bourge
2 CONC t cinq ans plus tard, Marguerite sunit en 1680 à Jean Marsolet, fils d
2 CONC e Nicolas Marsolet* de Saint-Aignan, et Louise épousa en 1688 Charles-Tho
2 CONC mas Couillard de Beaumont.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Sa femme, Anne Esmard, est inhumée à Pointe-Lévy le 15 janvier 170
2 CONC 0. Le 28 juin suivant, Guillaume Couture reconnaît devoir au « puisné d
2 CONC e ses fils », Joseph-Oger Couture, sieur de La Cressonnière, la somme d

2 CONC , parle de lui avec éloges. Couillard fut un des premiers habitants établ

2 CONC ouillard, à titre personnel, « cent arpents de terre pour déserter et ens
2 CONC emencer » aux abords de la rivière Saint-Charles. Ce colon avait près d
2 CONC e 20 arpents en culture dès 1632 et un moulin à farine en 1639. Cette mêm

2 CONT 
2 CONT       En fin de juin 1628, alarmé par lapproche des Anglais et la menac

2 CONC d continua à se dévouer pour la colonie et à jouir de lestime général

2 CONC .
2 CONT 
2 CONT       À la mort de Louis Hébert, en 1627, sa fille Guillemette et son ma
2 CONC ri, Guillaume Couillard, héritèrent de la moitié de ses biens. Couillar
2 CONC d devint le chef de la famille, car le frère de sa femme, Guillaume, étai
2 CONC t encore mineur. Jusquen 1632, la maison des Hébert, sise sur le bord d
2 CONC e la falaise, était la seule habitation privée à Québec. Il y avait un pe
2 CONC u plus loin le petit fort en bois construit par Champlain et, juste au-de
2 CONC ssous de celui-ci, au bord du fleuve, lHabitation flanquée de la petit
2 CONC e chapelle des Récollets. Les deux seuls autres bâtiments qui comptaien
2 CONC t étaient le couvent des Récollets et celui des Jésuites, situés à un mil
2 CONC le de là sur la rivière Saint-Charles et au delà dun bois épais. Guillem
2 CONC ette et sa mère restaient souvent seules chez elles, car Couillard passai
2 CONC t bien du temps sur le fleuve, et le serviteur, Henri, venu de France ave
2 CONC c les Hébert, avait été massacré par les sauvages lannée même de la mor
2 CONC t de Louis Hébert.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Comme ses parents, Mme Couillard sintéressait aux petits Indien
2 CONC s et fut marraine dun grand nombre dentre eux. Après la capture de Québ
2 CONC ec par les Anglais en 1629, elle accueillit chez elle Charité et Espéranc
2 CONC e, deux des trois petites Indiennes protégées par Champlain, que celui-c
2 CONC i aurait voulu remmener en France. David Kirke ayant refusé dautoriser c
2 CONC e voyage, les petites filles demandèrent dêtre envoyées chez Mme Couilla
2 CONC rd. Ce devait être un foyer cosmopolite, car il comprenait en outre Olivi
2 CONC er Le Jeune, petit nègre malgache que les Anglais avaient vendu à Olivie
2 CONC r Le Baillif et dont celui-ci avait fait don à la famille Couillard. Guil
2 CONC lemette et sa mère veillèrent à son instruction religieuse, et il fut bap
2 CONC tisé en 1633. En 1648, les Couillard avaient dautres serviteurs et dix e
2 CONC nfants ; cétait un ménage bruyant, voire indiscipliné, si lon en croi
2 CONC t le Journal des Jésuites. Au mariage de la troisième fille, Élisabeth, e
2 CONC n novembre 1645, deux violons  chose inouïe au Canada  accompagnaient l
2 CONC es chantres de la chapelle. Le début des années 1660 fut toutefois pour M
2 CONC me Couillard une période très pénible. Deux de ses fils, dabord Nicolas
2 CONC , âgé de 20 ans, puis Guillaume, âgé de 27 ans, et son neveu Joseph Héber
2 CONC t tombèrent victimes des Iroquois (16611662) et son mari décéda au moi
2 CONC s de mars 1663.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Riches propriétaires terriens (les Hébert possédaient des terres e
2 CONC n plus de leur concession primitive), Mme Couillard et son mari avaient f
2 CONC ait divers dons à des fins charitables et religieuses : à léglise en 165
2 CONC 2 et à lHôtel-Dieu en 1655 et en 1659. Devenue veuve, elle vendit à Mg
2 CONC r de Laval*, en 1666, le terrain nécessaire à la construction du petit sé

2 CONC e cette propriété de grande valeur (le fief du Sault-au-Matelot) où son m
2 CONC ari et elle sétaient dabord établis. Le litige amorcé par les héritier
2 CONC s présomptifs devait se poursuivre pendant des générations, voire jusqua
2 CONC u xxe siècle.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Chagrinée sans doute par cette querelle de famille et devenue inva

2 CONC n canadien à tirer sa subsistance lui-même du sol, marié à Marie Rollet
2 CONC , né à Paris en 1575 mort à Québec au mois de janvier 1627.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Daprès son descendant, Couillard-Després, il était le fils dun L
2 CONC ouis Hébert qui était apothicaire à la cour de Catherine de Médicis. De
2 CONC s documents, découverts plus récemment à Paris, indiquent que son père ét
2 CONC ait Nicolas Hébert, apothicaire, et que Louis est né au Mortier dOr, mai
2 CONC son située près du Louvre. La nièce de la femme de Nicolas Hébert épous
2 CONC a Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt, en 1590. Cette parenté expliquerai
2 CONC t lintérêt que Louis Hébert avait à légard des premiers établissement
2 CONC s en Acadie et sa présence dans lexpédition de Du Gua de Monts.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Lescarbot, qui se trouvait à Port-Royal en 1606, parle avec respec
2 CONC t de son talent de guérisseur et du plaisir quil trouvait à cultiver l
2 CONC a terre, et il indique, sur sa carte de la région, une île et une rivièr
2 CONC e qui portent le nom dHébert. À lété de 1606, Hébert accompagna Champla
2 CONC in et Poutrincourt le long de la côte, vers le Sud-Ouest, à la recherch
2 CONC e dautres emplacements propices à la colonisation. Poutrincourt et Héber
2 CONC t furent à ce point enchantés par ce qui est maintenant Gloucester, dan
2 CONC s le Massachusetts, quils y firent une petite plantation afin déprouve
2 CONC r la fertilité du sol. Lun et lautre voulaient venir sétablir avec leu
2 CONC rs familles au Nouveau Monde. Hébert montra au cours de ce voyage que, bi
2 CONC en que désireux de se livrer à des occupations pacifiques, il pouvait agi
2 CONC r promptement et avec courage en cas durgence. Avec Champlain, Poutrinco
2 CONC urt et plusieurs autres, il sauta presque nu dans une petite embarcation
2 CONC , au milieu de la nuit, en réponse aux cris frénétiques de quelques témér
2 CONC aires qui, restés sur le rivage malgré des ordres sévères, étaient attaqu
2 CONC és par des Indiens. Le Jonas, venu de France en juin 1607, était porteu
2 CONC r de mauvaises nouvelles : les concessions accordées à de Monts ayant ét
2 CONC é annulées, la compagnie devait rentrer en France.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1610, Hébert se retrouve à Port-Royal avec le groupe que Poutri
2 CONC ncourt espère y établir. En tant quapothicaire, il soigne les Blancs e
2 CONC t les Indiens. Il soccupe, semble-t-il, des aliments et des médicament
2 CONC s ; il prépare et administre les uns et les autres au chef Membertou pend
2 CONC ant la dernière maladie de ce dernier. Hébert dirige létablissement en 1
2 CONC 613, lorsque René Le Coq de La Saussaye arrive avec les colons de la marq
2 CONC uise de Guercheville, retire les deux Jésuites de Port-Royal et sen va f
2 CONC onder un nouvel établissement ailleurs. Mais lui et ses compagnons sont f
2 CONC aits prisonniers par les Anglais à lîle des Monts-Déserts, cet été-là, e
2 CONC t peu après Port-Royal est détruit (novembre 1613). Une fois de plus Hébe
2 CONC rt est contraint de retourner en France.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       À lhiver de 16161617, il renoue connaissance avec Champlain qu
2 CONC i est à Paris e quête dappuis pour sa colonie de Québec. Comme ce post
2 CONC e subsiste depuis neuf ans, Hébert y voit sans doute un lieu de colonisat
2 CONC ion sûr, étant donné surtout que Champlain lui a obtenu un contrat favora
2 CONC ble de la compagnie de traite des fourrures qui a la haute main sur la ré
2 CONC gion du Saint-Laurent. Confiant en ces promesses,  200 couronnes par a
2 CONC n pour ses services comme apothicaire, ainsi que le gîte et la nourritur
2 CONC e pour lui et sa famille pendant la période du défrichage,  Hébert ven
2 CONC d sa maison et son jardin à Paris et emmène sa femme, Marie Rollet, et se
2 CONC s trois enfants, Anne, Guillemette et Guillaume, à Honfleur où ils se pré
2 CONC parent à sembarquer. Une fois là, il constate que la compagnie na nulle
2 CONC ment lintention de faire honneur à ses engagements. Il doit se contente
2 CONC r dun nouveau contrat qui réduit de moitié son salaire et ses concession
2 CONC s et stipule que les membres de sa famille et son serviteur seront au ser
2 CONC vice de la compagnie sans rémunération. Nayant pas de choix, il accept
2 CONC e et part avec sa famille le 11 mars 1617.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       À Québec, son talent dapothicaire et sa petite provision de grai
2 CONC n furent une bénédiction pour les colons malades et affamés. Bien que lu
2 CONC i et ses serviteurs dussent consacrer une grande partie de leur temps à l
2 CONC a compagnie, il réussit à défricher et à planter une certaine étendue d
2 CONC e terre. Pendant le court séjour que Champlain fit à la colonie en 1618
2 CONC , il y trouva des terres « semées de beau grain » et des jardins où pouss
2 CONC aient toutes sortes de légumes.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Pendant bien des années Hébert fut le seul, outre Champlain lui-mê
2 CONC me, à cultiver la terre. La compagnie fit tout ce quelle put pour le dét
2 CONC ourner de lagriculture. Champlain et Sagard disent tous deux que les res
2 CONC trictions imposées illégalement par la compagnie à lactivité dHébert e
2 CONC t à lécoulement de ses produits lempêchèrent de jouir du fruit de son l
2 CONC abeur.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Lorsque, en 1620, Champlain revint de France muni dun mandat qui
2 CONC , en principe, lui donnait pleine autorité sur la colonie, il confia à Hé
2 CONC bert ladministration de la justice en le nommant procureur du roi. Ces
2 CONC t à ce titre que celui-ci signa la pétition adressée au roi par la coloni
2 CONC e en 1621. Hébert jouissait en outre de la confiance des Indiens que, con
2 CONC trairement à une foule de ses contemporains, il considérait comme des êtr
2 CONC es humains et intelligents, quil suffisait de former. Les exemples son
2 CONC t nombreux de leur respect et de leur affection pour lui. Il est aussi qu
2 CONC estion de relations commerciales entre Hébert et Guillaume de Caën mais
2 CONC , puisque le nom dHébert est très répandu, il se peut quil sagisse du
2 CONC ne erreur didentité.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1622, il demandait au vice-roi, par pétition, que la propriét
2 CONC é de ses terres lui fut reconnue, ce qui fut fait le 4 février 1623. Conn
2 CONC us plus tard sous le nom de fief du Sault-au-Matelot, ces terrains compre
2 CONC naient lemplacement actuel de la basilique, du séminaire, ainsi que de
2 CONC s rues Hébert et Couillard. Le titre de propriété fut ratifié le 28 févri
2 CONC er 1626 par le successeur du vice-roi, et lon ajouta quelques acres en b
2 CONC ordure de la rivière Saint-Charles,  le fief Saint-Joseph, plus tard con
2 CONC nu sous le nom de fief de Lespinay,  le tout devant être détenu en fie
2 CONC f noble.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Hébert avait réalisé son rêve le plus cher, celui de posséder suff
2 CONC isamment de ces terres vierges du Nouveau Monde pour vivre avec sa famill
2 CONC e dans lindépendance. Les prés en bordure de la rivière Saint-Charles of
2 CONC fraient les pâturages nécessaires à ses bovins ; les terres plus hautes l
2 CONC ogeaient ses champs de céréales, les jardins potagers et un verger plant
2 CONC é de pommiers apportés de Normandie. Hébert avait exécuté tous ces travau
2 CONC x malgré lopposition de la compagnie. De plus, il les avait exécutés a
2 CONC u moyen doutils manuels, puisquil navait même pas de charrue. (Ce nes
2 CONC t quun an après la mort dHébert quon put commencer à travailler la ter
2 CONC re, à une plus grande échelle, au moyen dune charrue tirée par des bufs
2 CONC .)A lhiver de 1626, Hébert fit sur la glace une chute mortelle. Il fut i
2 CONC nhumé le 25 janvier 1627 dans le cimetière des Récollets. En 1678, ses re
2 CONC stes, toujours dans son cercueil de cèdre, furent transportés dans le cav
2 CONC eau de la chapelle des Récollets, nouvellement construite ; avec ceux d
2 CONC u frère Pacifique Duplessis, ils furent les premiers à y reposer.

1 NOTE ROLLET, MARIE (Hébert ; Hubou), décédée à Québec en 1649.
2 CONT 
2 CONT         En 1617, avec son mari, Louis Hébert, et ses trois enfants, ell
2 CONC e arriva de Paris à Québec, pour y trouver la famine, la maladie et la me
2 CONC nace de lIndien. Lannée suivante, rapporte Sagard, eut lieu le premie
2 CONC r mariage célébré au Canada selon les rites de lEglise, celui de leur fi
2 CONC lle Anne avec Étienne Jonquet. Anne mourut lannée suivante en donnant na
2 CONC issance à un enfant qui nest pas porté sur les registres de la paroisse.
2 CONT 
2 CONT         Marie Rollet aida son mari à soigner les malades et partagea li
2 CONC ntérêt quil portait aux sauvages, en soccupant spécialement de linstru
2 CONC ction des jeunes Indiens. En 1627, lors du baptême du fils de Chomina, Na
2 CONC neogauchit, que le clergé voulait célébrer en grande pompe, une foule dI
2 CONC ndiens venus pour cette occasion se régalèrent du contenu de sa grosse ma
2 CONC rmite. Son nom figure souvent comme marraine au baptême dIndiens convert
2 CONC is.
2 CONT 
2 CONT         Deux ans après la mort de Louis Hébert, survenue le 16 mai 1629
2 CONC , elle convolait avec Guillaume Hubou. Après avoir demandé lavis de Cham
2 CONC plain, elle et sa famille (cest-à-dire son second époux, son fils Guilla
2 CONC ume de 15 ans ainsi que sa fille et son gendre, Guillaume Couillard) deme
2 CONC urèrent à Québec durant loccupation anglaise et perpétuèrent chez les In
2 CONC diens du voisinage la mémoire de lamitié français. Après le retour des F
2 CONC rançais, en 1632, sa maison devint le foyer des jeunes Indiennes confiée
2 CONC s aux Jésuites pour leur éducation. Elle mourut en 1649, en laissant so
2 CONC n mari, sa seule fille survivante, Guillemette Hébert, et de nombreux pet
2 CONC its-enfants. Elle fut inhumée à Québec le 27 mai 1649.

1 NOTE dit "l'Ecossais" ou "Maitre Abraham". Pilote, né en France en 1589, mor
2 CONC t à Québec le 8 septembre 1664.
2 CONT Martin arriva en Nouvelle-France vers 1620 avec sa femme, Marguerite Lan
2 CONC glois, sa soeur Françoise et son beau-frère Pierre Desportes (les parent
2 CONC s d'Hélène Desportes). Martin a pu être d'ascendance écossaise, ou il a p
2 CONC u prendre le sobriquet, soit qu'il servit dans l'armée, soit qu'il fit pa
2 CONC rtie d'une organisation clandestine: ces noms étaient employés pour masqu
2 CONC er l'identité des déserteurs, ou celle des membres d'une organisation ill
2 CONC égale au cas ou es documents seraient saisis. Il est également possible q
2 CONC u'on l'ait appelé ainsi parce qu'il avait accompli plusieurs voyages en E
2 CONC cosse durant sa jeunesse. On n'est pas absolument sur qu'il ait été pilot
2 CONC e officiel, encore qu'on lui ait parfois donné le titre de "pilote du roi
2 CONC " de son vivant. En tout cas, il est prouvé qu'il se livra à la pèche jus
2 CONC que dans le golfe du Saint-Laurent.
2 CONT Les plaines d'Abraham seraient ainsi appelées à cause de lui. Une anecdo
2 CONC te pittoresque rapporte que la "Cote d'Abraham" était le sentier emprunt
2 CONC é par Martin pour descendre à la rivière Saint-Charles abreuver ses anima
2 CONC ux. Son domaine comprenait 32 arpents (environ 48 acres) en tout, 12 arpe
2 CONC nts octroyés par la Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France en 1635 et 20 reçus e
2 CONC n cadeau du sieur Adrien Du Chesne, chirurgien naval de Pierre LeGardeu
2 CONC r de Repentigny en 1645. Cette propriété fut vendue par la famille Marti
2 CONC n aux Ursulines en 1667. Il est possible qu'il s'agisse du même Martin em
2 CONC ployé par Jean De Biencourt et Du Gua De Monts  comme navigateur sur la c
2 CONC ote de l'Acadie , bien qu'il fut alors très jeune. 
2 CONT Lorsque David Kirke prit Québec en 1629 et laissa son frère Lewis comm
2 CONC e gouverneur jusqu'en 1632, Martin et sa famille demeurèrent à Québec. Pl
2 CONC us tard, Martin baissa dans l'estime de ses concitoyens, lorsqu'il fut ac
2 CONC cusé de conduite repréhensible envers une jeune fille de Québec. Il fut e
2 CONC mprisonné le 15 février 1649 pour ce motif. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Les archives indiquent quAbraham Martin et Marquerite Langlois eurent n
2 CONC euf ou dix enfants. Anne Martin, née en France et mariée le 17 novembre 1
2 CONC 635 à Jean Côté, nétait probablement Pas la fille dAbraham. Eustache, b
2 CONC aptisé le 24 octobre 1621 et filleul dEustache Boullé, fut le premier Ca
2 CONC nadien de naissance. Marguerite, née le 4 janvier 1624 et mariée le 22 ma
2 CONC i 1638 à Étienne Racine, eut de nombreux descendants, y compris, les deu
2 CONC x évêques Racine. Hélène, née le 21 juin 1627, était la filleule de Samue
2 CONC l de Champlain. Elle épousa dabord Claude Étienne, en 1640, puis Médar
2 CONC d Chouart Des Groseilliers, le 3 septembre 1647. Charles-Amador*, né l
2 CONC e 7 mars 1648, filleul de Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour, fut le sec
2 CONC ond prêtre né au Canada. Il est possible que le frère Dominique Scot, men
2 CONC tionné dans les Relations des Jésuites comme sétant rendu en Huronie enc
2 CONC ore jeune homme, ait également été lun de ses fils. On peut aussi suppos
2 CONC er quun jeune homme qui est désigné comme sétant rendu en Huronie à l
2 CONC a même époque (16341635) fut Eustache Martin.
2 CONT Les titres de ses 2 terres sont dans les archives des Dames Ursulines.

2 CONC 4, mort au printemps de 1711, fils de Louis Rouer* de Villeray, conseille
2 CONC r du Conseil souverain, et de Catherine Sevestre ; il porta le nom de L
2 CONC a Cardonnière jusquà la mort de son père le 6 décembre 1700 et par la su
2 CONC ite, en sa qualité daîné de la famille, il hérita du titre de Villeray.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Comme son père occupait une place de premier plan dans la colonie
2 CONC , Augustin reçut le 27 avril 1684, conjointement avec son frère Louis Rou
2 CONC er* dArtigny, la seigneurie de lîle Verte comprenant deux lieues de fro
2 CONC nt sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent et deux lieues de profondeur dans les terr
2 CONC es avec les îles et îlots situés en face de cette rive. La paroisse de l
2 CONC Île-Verte est aujourdhui sise sur lemplacement de cette seigneurie.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Le 6 octobre 1685, Jacques de Meulles écrivait au ministre Seignel
2 CONC ay un long mémoire. Il demandait quon rétablisse en faveur de son protég
2 CONC é, Augustin de La Cardonnière, la charge de lieutenant particulier au siè
2 CONC ge de la Prévôté de Québec, « en attribuant audict office des gages raiso
2 CONC nnables ». Le ministre ne daigna pas donner suite à la demande de linten
2 CONC dant.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Le 24 avril 1688, Brisay de Denonville concédait la seigneurie d
2 CONC e Rimouski à Augustin de La Cardonnière. Celui-ci abandonnait à son frèr
2 CONC e dArtigny le domaine de lîle Verte et devenait seigneur de Rimouski. L
2 CONC a concession comprenait deux lieues de front sur le fleuve et deux lieue
2 CONC s de profondeur dans les terres. À cela sajoutaient lîle Saint-Barnabé
2 CONC , les îles et îlots adjacents.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Augustin Rouer de La Cardonnière demeura seigneur de Rimouski jusq
2 CONC uau 18 juillet 1694. À cette date, il échangeait son domaine avec René L
2 CONC epage, contre une terre que celui-ci possédait à Saint-François de lîl
2 CONC e dOrléans. Et, le 29 octobre 1703, le Conseil souverain de la Nouvelle-
2 CONC France acceptait M. de La Cardonnière, devenu M. de Villeray, au nombre d
2 CONC e ses membres.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       On ne retrouve pas lacte de sépulture de Villeray, mais tout semb
2 CONC le indiquer quil mourut au printemps de 1711. Il avait dabord épousé, l
2 CONC e 1er septembre 1689, Marie-Louise Legardeur, fîlle de Charles Legardeur
2 CONC * de Tilly, et ils eurent six enfants, puis en 1706 Marie-Louise Pollet f

2 CONC reste, décédé à Beauport le 7 février 1672.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Jean Juchereau et son épouse, Marie Langlois, vécurent, après 1628
2 CONC , à La Ferté-Vidame où leurs plus jeunes enfants sont nés. En 1634, la fa
2 CONC mille Juchereau passa en Nouvelle-France. Juchereau était un ami et un co
2 CONC llaborateur de Robert Giffard, avec qui il fit vraisemblablement la trave
2 CONC rsée.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Dès le 15 janvier 1635, dailleurs, les Cent-Associés lui concédai
2 CONC ent lespace de terre compris entre le cap aux Diamants et le vallon du C
2 CONC ap-Rouge. Toutefois, le gouverneur Huault de Montmagny ayant un peu plu
2 CONC s tard jugé préférable de laisser autour de Québec une banlieue qui relèv
2 CONC erait de la censive de la compagnie, le fief de Juchereau fut échangé pou
2 CONC r une superficie égale de terre située au delà de Cap-Rouge. Lintendan
2 CONC t des Cent-Associés, Jean de Lauson (père), prit la peine décrire à Juch
2 CONC ereau, le 19 mars 1636, pour lui expliquer la nouvelle politique de la co
2 CONC mpagnie.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1647, les possessions territoriales de Juchereau saccroissaien
2 CONC t : le 21 mars, par devant Teuleron, notaire à La Rochelle, Noël Jucherea
2 CONC u Des Chatelets achetait, au nom de son frère, le fief de Saint-Michel, p
2 CONC ropriété de M. de Puiseaux, et, le 18 septembre, le gouverneur concédai
2 CONC t à Jean et à Noël Juchereau la seigneurie de Maur où de Saint-Augustin
2 CONC . La concession fut ratifiée par la compagnie le 29 mars 1649, et Jean Ju
2 CONC chereau, héritier de son frère décédé depuis peu, fut mis en possession d
2 CONC e sa seigneurie le 9 avril 1650.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Sil sintéressa beaucoup au défrichement et à la colonisation, Ju
2 CONC chereau nen fut pas moins mêlé à la Communauté des Habitants. Un documen
2 CONC t de 1667 le dit « ci-devant assesseur à la Cour Souveraine de ce pays [C
2 CONC onseil souverain] et conseiller au conseil établi par le Roi pour la dire
2 CONC ction du commerce et de la traite de ce dit pays ».
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Il est évident que, à lépoque où il entra en possession de la sei
2 CONC gneurie de Maur, Juchereau était devenu un notable de la colonie : en 164
2 CONC 7, 1650 et 1651, il porte le dais aux processions de la Fête-Dieu ; en 16
2 CONC 51, le 1er janvier, il est parmi les quelques personnalités qui reçoiven
2 CONC t des étrennes des Jésuites ; en 1656 et 1657, enfin, il est marguillie
2 CONC r de léglise paroissiale de Québec. Personnage en vue à Québec et lun d
2 CONC es dirigeants de la Communauté des Habitants, Juchereau fût  avec combie
2 CONC n dautres !  accusé de malversations par lirascible et excessif Jean P
2 CONC eronne Dumesnil.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Vieillissant et ne jouant plus aucun rôle officiel, Juchereau, à p
2 CONC artir de 1663, fut quelques fois choisi par le Conseil souverain où par l
2 CONC es parties comme arbitre où curateur dune succession. En 1668, M. de Pro
2 CONC uville de Tracy proposa au roi de lanoblir avec quelques-uns des princip
2 CONC aux habitants du pays. Mais le roi ne donna pas suite à cette suggestion.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Enfin, le 4 janvier 1672, sentant son heure proche, Juchereau sign
2 CONC ait avec ses héritiers un acte par lequel il cédait sa seigneurie de Mau
2 CONC r à son fils aîné, Jean Juchereau de La Ferté.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Son épouse, Marie Langlois, avait été inhumée à Québec le 15 janvi
2 CONC er 1661. Quant à Jean Juchereau de Maur, il mourut à Beauport « en lhabi

2 CONC r, Louis Rouer de Villeray avait tout juste dépassé la vingtaine quand i
2 CONC l débarqua au Canada. en 1650 ou 1651. A son arrivée, il fut soldat à Qué
2 CONC bec, puis à Trois-rivières, ou il fut remarqué par Pierre Boucher', qui e
2 CONC n fit son homme de confiance en le constituant, par un acte signé devan
2 CONC t Séverin Ameau le 20 Octobre 1653, "son procurer général et spécial [...
2 CONC ] pour accomplir les mémoires des marchandises que le dit Sieur Boucher d
2 CONC ésire faire venir aux dites Trois-rivières ".            L'année suivante
2 CONC , Rouer revint à Québec, où le gouverneur Jean de Lauson se l'attacha com
2 CONC me secrétaire. Son fils, Charles, le continua dans cette charge. Il fut e
2 CONC n même temps notaire, de 1653 à 1657, et commis-greffier en la juridictio
2 CONC n de Québec. Il remplit aussi la fonction. assez peu onéreuse a cette épo
2 CONC que, de juge-Prévot de la cote de Beaupré.          
2 CONT Son mariage avec Catherine Sevestre, le 19 février 1658, améliora consid
2 CONC érablement sa situation. Son beau-père, Charles SEVESTRE, étant mort deu
2 CONC x mois auparavant, il hérita d'une concession d'un arpent de front par di
2 CONC x de profondeur entre la Grande Allée et le fleuve, avec droit de pêche
2 CONC . Le gouverneur Louis D'Ailleboust lui donna aussi la succession de Charl
2 CONC es Sevestre dans les deux charges de lieutenant particulier de la Sénécha

2 CONC bec.                                            
2 CONT Les comptes assez embrouillés laissés par son beau-père créèrent des dif
2 CONC ficultés a Villeray. Quand il fut, peu après, élu au Conseil de la traite
2 CONC , on l'accusa d'occuper cette charge illicitement, puisqu'il n'avait pa
2 CONC s encore réglé les comptes de Charles Sevestre. Les plaintes contre Ville
2 CONC ray parvinrent a la cour et, par un édit royal daté du 13 mai 1659, il fu
2 CONC t démis de ses fonctions et reçut l'ordre d'aller en France, à l'automne
2 CONC , se disculper et présenter les comptes de Charles Sevestre avec pièces j
2 CONC ustificatives. De retour le printemps suivant. il fut rétabli dans sa cha
2 CONC rge. Mais comme le Conseil de la traite persistait à le tenir responsabl
2 CONC e des sommes dépensées par son beau-père sur la seule autorité du gouvern
2 CONC eur du temps, Villeray, qui avait cependant l'appui du gouverneur de Voye
2 CONC r d'Argenson, dut repasser  en France en 1660 et en 1662 pour défendre  s
2 CONC a cause.                                           
2 CONT Ses efforts ne furent pas vains. Le 19 janvier 1663, la Compagnie de l
2 CONC a Nouvelle-France lui confirma la concession des terres héritées de son b
2 CONC eau-père, lui accorda les trois ou quatre arpents dont la Possession lu
2 CONC i était contestée, et donna au tout la désignation de fief Villeray. Il r
2 CONC eçut, la même année, une promotion d'importance. Quand, le 18 Septembre 1
2 CONC 663, le gouverneur de Saffray de Mezy et Mgr de Laval' choisirent les cin
2 CONC q membres qui devaient constituer avec eux-mêmes le Conseil souverain, Vi
2 CONC lleray fut le premier nommé. A partir de ce moment, Rouer de Villeray  eu
2 CONC t un rôle de premier plan à jouer dans la direction des affaires judiciai
2 CONC res et administratives de la colonie. Un des premiers actes du Conseil so
2 CONC uverain fut dirigé contre l'avocat JEAN PÉRONNE Dumesnil, officier supéri
2 CONC eur que la Compagnie de la Nouvelle France avait envoyé dans la colonie
2 CONC , en 1660, en qualité de contrôleur général, Intendant des Cent-Associe
2 CONC s et juge souverain: ses accusations et ses inquisitions lui avaient alié
2 CONC né tous les hommes en place. Villeray et JEAN Bourdon  reçurent mission d
2 CONC e saisir les documents dont Dumesnil s'était empare et de le chasser de s
2 CONC a  maison, qui appartenait a la colonie. Ils accomplirent  leur tâche ave
2 CONC c l'assistance d'une dizaine de soldats.    
2 CONT Au conseil, des désaccords ne tardèrent pas à  s'établir entre le gouver
2 CONC neur et l'évêque. Après que le conseil se fut rangé du coté de l'évêqu
2 CONC e  sur la question des dîmes, Mezy, par son ordonnance du 13 février 1664
2 CONC , suspendit Rouer de Villeray, Ruette d'Auteuil et le procureur général B
2 CONC ourdon: il les accusait d'usurper l'autorité du gouverneur et de fomente
2 CONC r la sédition de concert avec l'évêque. Il revint sur sa décision deux mo
2 CONC is plus tard, mais de nouvelles dissensions furent créées à l'occasion d
2 CONC e l'élection d'un syndic des habitants. Une réunion de citoyens avait ét
2 CONC é convoquée par le gouverneur seul pour choisir le syndic, la conseiller
2 CONC s protestèrent. Furieux de leur opposition, le gouverneur démit de leur
2 CONC s fonctions, le 19 Septembre 1664, Pourdon. Villeray, d'Auteuil et JEAN J
2 CONC UCHEREAU DE LA FERTÉ:  Villeray était absent, s'étant embarque pour la Fr
2 CONC ance le 30 août précédent. Le 24 Septembre, le gouverneur nommait trois n
2 CONC ouveaux conseillers, mais sans l'assentiment, obligatoire, de l'évêque. D
2 CONC ans un mémoire présenté au roi. Villeray accusa Mezy d'être jaloux des po
2 CONC uvoirs du conseil et d'être fâché de n'avoir pas obtenu une augmentatio
2 CONC n de son traitement. La mort de Mezy empêcha seule sa destitution.  En Fr
2 CONC ance, Villeray rencontra probablement TALON, nouvellement nommé intendan
2 CONC t de la Nouvelle-France. Il obtint que celui-ci intercédat auprès du mini
2 CONC stre pour que Villeray et quelques autres Canadiens puissent charger su
2 CONC r un navire de la Compagnie des Indes occidentales les provisions acheté
2 CONC s dans la métropole. C'est aussi probablement avec l'intendant qu'il revi
2 CONC nt a Québec a l'été de 1665. Le 6 Décembre 1666. il reçut a nouveau la ch
2 CONC arge de premier conseiller, cette fois de Prouville de Tracy.  Jusqu'à c
2 CONC e moment, Villeray avait passe pour être complètement dévoue a l'évêque e
2 CONC t aux Jésuites. Mais il semble que, peu après, son attachement a Talon fu
2 CONC t le plus fort. Lorsque, le 10 Novembre 1668 l'Intendant proposa un arrê
2 CONC t permettant la vente de l'eau-de-vie aux sauvages. Villeray vota en fave
2 CONC ur de la mesure. C'était un affront à l'évêque: Villeray n'avait-il pas é
2 CONC té élu plus tôt marguillier de la paroisse de Québec '! Sa relations ave
2 CONC c l'évêque continuèrent portant d'être bonnes. Et Talon, qui le protégeai
2 CONC t, lui accorda le poste de receveur de l'impôt de dix pour cent sur les m

2 CONC l fut assimilé aux parlements du royaume ; ses membres furent nommés à vi
2 CONC e par commission royale. Villeray fut à nouveau nommé premier conseille
2 CONC r par commission datée du 26 avril 1675. Il continua donc à jouir de cett
2 CONC e distinction qui le faisait « primus inter pares », suivant lexpressio
2 CONC n du gouverneur Louis-Hector de Callière*. Le roi lui manifesta encore so
2 CONC n estime en lui faisant verser 2 500ª, son traitement pour les cinq année
2 CONC s pendant lesquelles il avait été exclu du conseil.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En dépit dune définition suffisamment précise de leurs pouvoirs r
2 CONC espectifs, les difficultés entre Frontenac et Duchesneau ne se firent pa
2 CONC s attendre. Mais, en 1679, la plus sérieuse querelle éclata, au sujet d
2 CONC e la présidence du conseil ; Duchesneau délégua Villeray et Bermen* de L
2 CONC a Martinière auprès du gouverneur, suggérant que la question fût référé
2 CONC e au roi. Le gouverneur refusa tout net et exigea quon lui accordât la d
2 CONC irection effective. Limpasse dura des mois. Finalement, Frontenac  pos
2 CONC a un ultimatum. Le conseil resta sur ses positions. Le 4 juillet, Fronten
2 CONC ac fit parvenir des ordres écrits à trois conseillers de quitter Québe
2 CONC c : dAuteuil, procureur général, Villeray et Charles Legardeur de Tilly
2 CONC . Ce dernier fut contraint de se retirer à lîle dOrléans. Les conseille
2 CONC rs se réunirent chez lintendant, les 4 et 5 juillet, mais sans résultat
2 CONC . Un accord temporaire ne fut conclu que le 16 octobre : dAuteuil et Til
2 CONC ly purent retourner chez eux, mais Villeray devait aller rendre compte d
2 CONC e sa conduite au roi. À la grande surprise de Frontenac, Villeray, loin d
2 CONC être inquiet davoir à se justifier devant le roi, semblait confiant do
2 CONC btenir lapprobation royale. Villeray avait raison. Il revint en octobr
2 CONC e avec un ordre pour son rétablissement au conseil et une dépêche, daté
2 CONC e du 29 avril 1680, dans laquelle le roi exprimait son mécontentement e
2 CONC t sa condamnation des prétentions de Frontenac.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Lintendant demanda au roi une gratification pour compenser les pe
2 CONC rtes et les dépenses que le gouverneur avait occasionnées à Villeray. So
2 CONC n exil, survenu au temps de la moisson, lui avait été fort préjudiciable
2 CONC , puisquil vivait du produit de ses terres. Dès 1668, il avait réuni, pa
2 CONC r héritage et par achat, 103 ou 104 arpents, tous pris entre le fleuve e
2 CONC t la Grande Allée, à louest de la porte Saint-Louis. Il avait par la sui
2 CONC te arrondi son domaine. En 1675, il avait acheté de René Robinau de Bécan
2 CONC cour un fief dun arpent par dix. Plus tard, il loua de Talon, au prix d
2 CONC e 250* par an, le comté dOrsainville.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Linimitié du gouverneur était tenace. À une séance du conseil e
2 CONC n mars 1681, Frontenac fit une remontrance à Villeray et lui défendit d
2 CONC e se servir du titre décuyer, malgré la production de ses pièces justifi
2 CONC catives. Mais Frontenac fut rappelé peu après et les relations entre se
2 CONC s successeurs et Villeray furent excellentes. Le 27 avril 1684, Villera
2 CONC y obtint pour ses fils la seigneurie de lÎle-Verte. La même année, il fu
2 CONC t du nombre des 18 notables consultés sur la traite.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Le gouverneur de Brisay* de Denonville avait la plus haute opinio
2 CONC n de son désintéressement et de son intelligence. Il dit lavoir retenu
2 CONC , alors quil voulait passer en France, parce quil navait personne de p
2 CONC lus capable de lui donner connaissance des affaires du Conseil souverain
2 CONC . Le gouverneur approuva la demande de Villeray au roi de rétablir la fon
2 CONC ction de lieutenant particulier de Québec et dy nommer son fils pour qu
2 CONC il puisse étudier et se rendre capable de lui succéder. Mais cette demand
2 CONC e fut rejetée.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1686, Villeray commença une nouvelle phase de sa carrière, comm
2 CONC e agent de la Ferme. Lagent envoyé par la compagnie, Gilles de Boyvinet
2 CONC , sétant noyé à Québec le 22 juillet, lintendant Bochart* de Champigny
2 CONC , après consultation avec le gouverneur, donna à Villeray la commission d
2 CONC e contrôleur de la Compagnie du Canada, à cause de lhonnêteté douteuse d
2 CONC u sieur de La Héronnière, nommé par intérim par lintendant Duchesneau.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       À lautomne de la même année, Villeray passa en France. Il obtin
2 CONC t une gratification du roi et le titre de directeur général de la Ferme p
2 CONC our la Compagnie Pointeau. Quand il revint, il trouva sa maison en cendre
2 CONC s. Le gouverneur et lintendant demandèrent la continuation de sa gratuit
2 CONC é.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1688, il obtint pour son fils cadet la seigneurie de Rimouski
2 CONC , son aîné prenant possession de toute la seigneurie de lÎle-Verte.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Après le retour de Frontenac, en 1689, Villeray fut délégué auprè
2 CONC s du gouverneur pour le prier dassister aux séances du conseil. Après bi
2 CONC en des pourparlers, on se mit daccord pour recevoir Frontenac avec tout
2 CONC e la pompe quil désirait, ce qui améliora les relations avec lui par l
2 CONC a suite.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Au dire de lintendant Champigny, Villeray remplissait ses devoir
2 CONC s dagent général de la Ferme avec soin et fidélité. Le 10 novembre 1692
2 CONC , il fut nomme procureur des Associés de Paris, anciens fermiers de la Co
2 CONC mpagnie dOudiette, qui détenaient un tiers des actions dans la Compagni
2 CONC e du Nord.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Et sil en faut croire Lamothe Cadillac [Laumet*], qui sen offusq
2 CONC uait, en 1693, Villeray tenait boucherie dans sa maison, son valet y débi
2 CONC tait la viande et sa femme était caissière.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1694, quand Pierre Le Moyne* dIberville eut besoin de fonds po
2 CONC ur son expédition à la baie dHudson, une assemblée de la Compagnie du No
2 CONC rd fut convoquée. Villeray, procureur des Associés de Paris, avoua qui
2 CONC l navait pas reçu dinstructions à ce sujet, mais offrit demprunter à 1
2 CONC 2 p. 100 dintérêt pour avoir part à lentreprise, ce quon lui refusa.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Lannée suivante, Frontenac se plaignit à lun de ses protecteur
2 CONC s que Villeray avait eu la hardiesse de lui dire en plusieurs rencontre
2 CONC s quil ne le regardait au conseil que comme un membre honoraire.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1698, sur lordre du ministre, lintendant examina les terres d
2 CONC u sieur de Villeray sur lesquelles les fortifications de Québec avaient é
2 CONC té érigées. Il rapporta quen 1690, on avait enlevé le gazon sur 3 arpent
2 CONC s, creusé au roc 7 arpents pour les redoutes, quen tout 23 arpents avaie
2 CONC nt été occupés et quune glacière avait été enlevée ; quen conséquence
2 CONC , Villeray demandait une indemnité substantielle ou une augmentation de s
2 CONC a gratification annuelle. Le ministre lui accorda une pension viagère d
2 CONC e 400ª.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1698 également, une querelle sétait élevée entre les habitant
2 CONC s et les agents de la Ferme sur la date à laquelle toutes les fourrures d
2 CONC evaient leur être rapportées. Pour hâter le départ des vaisseaux, les age
2 CONC nts voulaient la fixer au le, octobre, les habitants, au 20. Lintendan
2 CONC t suggéra comme compromis la date du 10 octobre.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Le 6 décembre 1700, âgé de 71 ans, Villeray mourut lors dune épid
2 CONC émie qui sévissait à Québec. Rouer avait épousé, le 19 février 1658, Cath
2 CONC erine, fille de Charles Sevestre et de Marie Pichon. Il en eut trois enfa
2 CONC nts : Augustin Rouer* de La Cardonnière et de Villeray, Louis Rouer* dAr
2 CONC tigny et Charles Rouer de Villeray. Catherine Sevestre mourut à Québec e
2 CONC n 1670. En secondes noces, Louis Rouer avait épousé, le 26 novembre 1675
2 CONC , Marie-Anne, fille de Jacques Du Saussay de Béniont et dAnne Carlier, q
2 CONC ui retourna en France quelque temps après le décès de son mari. À parti
2 CONC r de 1702, la veuve reçut une pension de 200ª, et dArtigny, une pensio
2 CONC n de 1504 pour compensation des terres utilisées pour les fortifications.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Le gouverneur de Callière, en guise doraison funèbre, écrivit a
2 CONC u ministre que Louis Rouer de Villeray avait été nommé premier conseille
2 CONC r à cause de son mérite et de son savoir et que sa mémoire était respecté
2 CONC e dans tout le pays.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En Villeray, la colonie perdait un de ses grands fonctionnaires. I
2 CONC ntelligent et actif, il avait tôt attiré lattention des gouverneurs. I
2 CONC I avait conservé la protection de presque tous les administrateurs du pay
2 CONC s par son zèle, son honnêteté et son bon jugement, dans les affaires juri
2 CONC diques aussi bien que financières. Premier conseiller, il avait voulu fai
2 CONC re respecter les pouvoirs et prérogatives du Conseil souverain, mais sét
2 CONC ait satisfait de suivre le parti avec lequel il se sentait le plus en sym
2 CONC pathie, celui de lévêque, puis celui de lintendant. On ne peut lui teni
2 CONC r rigueur de ses difficultés avec Frontenac : seuls les protégés du gouve
2 CONC rneur étaient à labri de ses foudres. Il avait passé 50 ans au pays. Dan
2 CONC s sa charge de premier conseiller, quil avait remplie durant plus de 3
2 CONC 0 ans, dans sa position dagent de la Ferme, quil avait occupée durant p
2 CONC rès de 15 ans, aussi bien que dans la gérance de ses terres, il sétait m

2 CONC s de mener de front plusieurs tâches absorbantes, maintes fois interrompu

2 CONT 
2 CONT       On ignore quelle fut la première occupation de Charles Sevestr

2 CONC t procureur-syndic de la même Communauté. Cest à ce titre quil fut appe

2 NOTE Andre was involved in some local Acadian history, and was quite famous i
3 CONC n that area. It seems that Claude de LaTour held the St. John River are
3 CONC a in what is now New Brunswick (then Acadia). Isaac de Razilly of Tourain
3 CONC e granted Latour the Signeurie de Jemseg, a rich hunting and fishing are
3 CONC a along the Sainte John River in New Brunswick. It was there that Claud
3 CONC e de LaTour built the fort Jemsig. Andre Bernard arrived in Acadia in 164
3 CONC 1 in order to serve with Sieur Charles de Latour at Fort Jemseg. In April
3 CONC , .... de Aulinay (Governor of Acadia) decided to mount a decisive attac
3 CONC k on fort Jemseg. Madame de LaTour and 50 men bravely resisted the attack
3 CONC . At the time, Claude de LaTour was in Boston. It was a murderous fight
3 CONC . d'Aulnay lost 33 men, but succeeded in capturing the fort after a three
3 CONC -day battle ending on April 17, 1645. He seized 'jewels, silver and furni
3 CONC shings worth up to 10,000 louis'. Many of LaTour's men were hanged afte
3 CONC r Council deliberations, 'to serve as an example, and as a lesson to post
3 CONC erity of such an obstinate rebellion.' Andre Bernard's life was spared wh

3 CONC g by d'Aulnay, in 1645 he escaped to France vai New York, and later retur

1 OCCU arpenteur-mesureur, maître maçon, architecte-entrepreneur, marchand, bour
2 CONC geois, ingénieur.  
2 CONT François exerça son métier d'arpenteur à Paris avant de venir s'établ
2 CONC i à Québec, en 1689 ou peu avant, à l'age de 33 ans environ. Il logea che
2 CONC z Pierre Ménage dont il épousa la fille, Marie-Anne. Les Lajoüe résidèren
2 CONC t rue Saint-Louis, près des Ménage, jusqu'en 1700 environ; ils se firen
2 CONC t ensuite construire une demeure vis-à-vis de la fontaine Royale, rue d
2 CONC u Garde-fou. C'est dans cette maison, en pierre et en mansarde, que son
2 CONC t venus se réfugier les Bégon, chassés du palais dans la nuit tragique d
2 CONC u 5 au 6 janvier 1713.
2 CONT La carrière canadienne de Lajoüe dura un quart de siècle. Le 22 décembr
2 CONC e 1689, Lajoüe reçut sa commission de mesureur et d'arpenteur royal. Pa
2 CONC r la suite, son activité se partagea entre l' expertise, le mesurage et l
2 CONC a construction, avec une tentative commerciale avortée. La première comma
2 CONC nde d'importance que nous lui connaissions est le projet d'un bâtiment d
2 CONC e 100 pieds de long dont il commença la construction pour les religieuse
2 CONC s hospitalières en 1691 et dont il fit un petit relief; ce bâtiment ne fu
2 CONC t pas achevé avant 1698. En 1692, il soumit les plans pour la constructio
2 CONC n du château et du nouveau fort. A propos du château, Frontenac déclarai
2 CONC t que « ce n'est pas sans quelque espèce de miracle que je n'ai point ét
2 CONC é accablé sous les ruines du vieux bâtiment », dans lequel il voyait néan
2 CONC moins un des ornements de la ville de Québec. Cette construction ne fut p
2 CONC as terminee avant 1700. En 1693, il construisit la porte St-Jean avec so
2 CONC n confrère et associé La Rivière, conformément aux dessins de Beaucours
2 CONC . Janson, dit Lapalme, et Jean le Rouge bâtirent la porte Saint-Louis su
2 CONC r le même modèle. La même année, Lajoue passa en France pour enquêter su
2 CONC r les titres et l'inventaire d'un nommé Leboeuf. En 1700, il dirigea la c
2 CONC onstruction du château et de la nouvelle enceinte et il devint actionnair
2 CONC e de la Compagnie de la Colonie. En 1702, il soumit des recommandations p
2 CONC our la restauration de l'église de Sainte-Famille, à l'Ile d'Orléans. E
2 CONC n 1703, il soumit un plan au séminaire pour la construction d'un nouvea
2 CONC u presbytère, et, I'année suivante, il s'occupa de l'église des Jésuite
2 CONC s à Sillery. Il commanda vers cette date « un beau tabernacle » à Hulot
2 CONC , sculpteur du duc d'Orléans, oeuvre qu'il voulait donner aux religieuse
2 CONC s de l'Hôtel-Dieu dont il était l'architecte attitré. Il versa une avanc
2 CONC e de 400 francs mais ne put payer le reste, ses affaires ayant baissé. Le
2 CONC s religieuses durent intervenir auprès de la cour pour récupérer cet orne
2 CONC ment qui avait été saisi, et ce n'est que 12 ans plus tard, le jour de l'
2 CONC Assomption, qu'il fut placé dans l'église à l'occasion des travaux de réf
2 CONC ection. En 1708, il fournit un plan des canalisations de l'Hôtel-Dieu su
2 CONC r lequel sont spécifiés les « endroits ou on veut faire passer les eaux d
2 CONC e la ville de Quebec concedées par M. Talon ». Ces travaux furent ajourné
2 CONC s. On le retrouve en 1710 armateur de l'Africain, vaisseau de 431 tonneau
2 CONC x dont la faillite fut la cause de démêlés entre lui et Denis Riverin - i
2 CONC l accusa ce dernier de l'avoir embarqué dans uné mauvaise affaire et de l
2 CONC 'avoir trompé. En 1714 eten 1715, il aurait travaillé pour les Récollet
2 CONC s et peut-étre pour les Ursulines. Dour lesquelles il aurait préparé le
2 CONC s plans de leur église. (Il s'agit d'hypothèses qu'il nous a été impossib
2 CONC le de vérifier ) Nous conservons de lui un plan du séminaire qui montre é
2 CONC galement la cathédrale et l'évêché. Il quitta le pays vers 1715, après av
2 CONC oir confié ses effets à la garde des religieuses de l'Hôtel-Dieu En 171
2 CONC 7 et en 1718, on le dit absent. Une lettre de l'évêque de Babylone, daté
2 CONC e du 30 juillet 1719, nous apprend qu'il est décédé en Perse, ou il tenai
2 CONC t les fonctions d'ingénieur. L'inventaire de ses papiers daté du 3 avri
2 CONC l 1721, offre peu d'intérét, sinon la mention de 16 procès-verbaux d'arpe
2 CONC ntage « tirés par La Joue en qualité d'arpenteur-juré ». Le règlement d
2 CONC e la succession vacante de Lajoue eut des prolongements jusqu'en 1743. L
2 CONC a carrière de Lajoue bénéficia de l'administration énergique des gouverne
2 CONC urs Frontenac, Calliere, Vaudreuil [Rigaud] et d'intendants tels que Cham
2 CONC pigny [Bochart]. L'échec de Phips contre Québec et le traité de Ryswick f
2 CONC avorisaient les grands projets: Québec s'entoura alors de sa première enc
2 CONC einte régulière et reçut sa parure de bâtiments et de clochers. Pour ce
2 CONC s constructions des militaires, choisis pour leurs qualités artisanales
2 CONC , étaient secondés par l'équipe du séminaire; cette institution avait un
2 CONC e école d'art qui groupait Baillif, Denis Mallet, Jacques Leblond de Lato
2 CONC ur, auprès desquels évoluaient des personnages tels que Lajoue, Ménage, L
2 CONC a Rivière. Après la mort tragique et prématurée de Baillif, survenue en 1
2 CONC 699, Lajoue tint un rôle prépondérant dans la construction. Le travail de
2 CONC s architectes fut d'ailleurs parallèle à celui des menuisiers et des déco
2 CONC rateurs d'intérieurs. L'oeuvre des architectes fut perpétuée par les réal
2 CONC isations des maitres décorateurs, dont les retables, tabernacles, baldaqu
2 CONC ins sont autant de temples fictifs dérivés des grands modèles. Mais la na
2 CONC ture du matériau disponible et la rareté de certains moyens empéchaient s

1 NOTE LAJOÜE, FRANÇOIS DE, arpenteur-mesureur, maître maçon, architecte-entrepr
2 CONC eneur, marchand, bourgeois, ingénieur, né vers 1656 dans la région parisi
2 CONC enne (Saint-Giruault), fils de Jacques de La Joue,, maître chirurgien, e
2 CONC t de Madeleine Guérin, décédé en Perse en 1719 ou peu avant.
2 CONT François exerça son métier d'arpenteur 'à Paris avant de venir s'établi
2 CONC r 'à Québec, en 1689 ou peu avant, à l'âge de 33 ans environ. Il logea ch
2 CONC ez Pierre Ménage dont il épousa la fille, Marie-Anne, le 3 novembre 1689
2 CONC . De cette union naquirent plusieurs filles dont Marie-Agnès et MarieThér
2 CONC èse, qui épousèrent respectivement PierreNoël Levasseur et l'ingénieur La
2 CONC guer de Morville. Les Lajoüe résidèrent rue Saint-Louis, près des Ménage
2 CONC , jusqu'en 1700 environ; ils se firent ensuite construire une demeure vis
2 CONC -à-vis de la fontaine Royale, rue du Garde-fou. C'est dans cette maison
2 CONC , en pierre et en mansarde, que sont venus se réfugier les Bégon, chassé
2 CONC s du palais dans la nuit tragique du 5 au 6 janvier 1713.
2 CONT La carrière canadienne de Lajoüe dura un quart de siècle, dans la périod
2 CONC e d'activité de Vauban [Le Prestre] en France, des ingénieurs Jacques Lev
2 CONC asseur de Neré et Boisberthelot de Beaucours au Canada. Le 22 décembre 16
2 CONC 89, Lajoüe reçut sa commission de mesureur et d'arpenteur royal, en mêm
2 CONC e temps que Bernard de La Rivière. Par la suite, son activité se partage
2 CONC a entre l'expertise, le mesurage et la construction, avec une tentative -
2 CONC commerciale avortée. La première commande d'importance que nous lui conna
2 CONC issions est le projet d'un bâtiment de 100 pieds de long dont il commenç
2 CONC a la construction pour les religieuses hospitalières en 1691 et dont il f
2 CONC it un petit relief; ce bâtiment ne fut pas achevé avant 1698. En 1692, i
2 CONC l soumit les plans pour la construction du château et du nouveau fort
2 CONC . A propos du château, Frontenac [Buade1 déclarait que « ce n'est pas san
2 CONC s quelque espèce de miracle que je n'ai point été accablé sous les ruine
2 CONC s du vieux bâtiment », dans lequel il voyait néanmoins un des ornements d
2 CONC e la ville de Québec. Cette construction ne fut pas terminée avant 1700
2 CONC . En 1693, il construisit la porte Saint-Jean avec son confrère et associ
2 CONC é La Rivière, conformément aux dessins de Beaucours. Janson, dit Lapalme
2 CONC , et Jean LE ROUGE bâtirent la porte Saint-Louis sur le même modèle. La m
2 CONC ême année, Lajoüe passa en France pour enquêter sur les titres et l'inven
2 CONC taire d'un nommé Leboeuf.
2 CONT En 1700, il dirigea la construction du château et de la nouvelle enceint
2 CONC e et il devint actionnaire de la Compagnie de la Colonie. En 1702, il sou
2 CONC mit des recommandations pour la restauration de l'église de Sainte-Famill
2 CONC e, à l'Ile d'Orléans. En 1703, il soumit un plan au séminaire pour la con
2 CONC struction d'un nouveau presbytère, et, l'année suivante, il s'occupa de l
2 CONC 'église des Jésuites à Sillery. Il com- manda vers cette date « un beau t
2 CONC abernacle » à Hulot, sculpteur du duc d'Orléans, oeuvre qu'il voulait don
2 CONC ner aux religieuses de ]«Hôtel-Dieu dont il était l'architecte attitré. I
2 CONC l versa une avance de 400 francs mais ne put payer le reste, ses affaire
2 CONC s ayant baissé. Les religieuses durent inter- venir auprès de la cour pou
2 CONC r récupérer cet ornement   qui avait été saisi, et ce n'est que 12 ans pl
2 CONC us tard, le jour de l'Assomption, qu'il fut placé dans l'église à l'occas
2 CONC ion des travaux de réfection. En 1708, il fournit un plan des canalisatio
2 CONC ns de l'Hôtel-Dieu sur lequel sont spécifiés les « endroits où on veut fa
2 CONC ire passer les eaux de la ville de Québec conceddées par M. Talon [ ] »
2 CONC . Ces travaux furent ajournés. On le retrouve en 1710 armateur de l'Afric
2 CONC ain, vaisseau de 431 tonneaux dont la faillite fut la cause de démêlés en
2 CONC tre lui et Denis Riverin ; il accusa ce dernier de l'avoir embarqué dan
2 CONC s une mauvaise affaire et de l'avoir trompé. En 1714 et en 1715, il aurai
2 CONC t travaillé pour les Récollets et peutêtre pour les Ursulines, pour lesqu
2 CONC elles il aurait préparé les plans de leur église. (Il s'agit d'hypo. thès
2 CONC es qu'il nous a été impossible de vérifier.) Nous conservons de lui un pl
2 CONC an du séminaire qui montre également la cathédrale et l'évêché.
2 CONT Il quitta le pays vers 1715, après avoir confié ses effets à la garde de
2 CONC s religieuses de l'Hôtel-Dieu. En 1717 et en 1718, on le dit absent. Un
2 CONC e lettre de l'évêque de Babylone, datée du 30 juillet 1719, nous appren
2 CONC d qu'il est décédé en Perse, où il tenait les fonctions d'ingénieur. l'in
2 CONC ventaire de ses papiers, daté du 3 avril 1721, offre peu d'intérêt, sino
2 CONC n la mention de 16 procès-verbaux d'arpentage « tirés par La Joue en qual
2 CONC ité d'arpenteur-juré ». Le règlement de la succession vacante de Lajoüe e
2 CONC ut des prolongements jusqu'en 1743.
2 CONT La carrière de Lajoüe bénéficia de l'administration énergique des gouver
2 CONC neurs Frontenac, Callière, Vaudreuil [Rigaud] et d'intendants tels que Ch
2 CONC ampigny [Bochart]. L'échec de Phips contrer Québec et le traité de Ryswic
2 CONC k favorisaient lés grands projets : Québec s'entoura alors de -sa premièr
2 CONC e enceinte régulière et reçut sa parure de bâtiments et de clochers. Pou
2 CONC r ces constructions, des militaires, choisis pour leurs qualités artisana
2 CONC les, étaient secondés par l'équipe du séminaire; cette institution avai
2 CONC t une école d'art qui groupait Baillif, Denis Mallet, Jacques Leblond d
2 CONC e Latour, auprès desquels évoluaient des personnages tels que Lajoüe, Mén
2 CONC age, La Rivière. Après la mort tragique et prématurée de Baillif, survenu
2 CONC e en 1699, Lajoüe tint un rôle prépondérant dans la construction.
2 CONT Le travail des architectes fut d'ailleurs parallèle à celui des menuisie
2 CONC rs et des décorateurs d'intérieurs. L'oeuvre des architectes fut perpétué
2 CONC e par les réalisations des maitres décorateurs, dont les retables, tabern
2 CONC acles, baldaquins sont autant de temples fictifs dérivés des grands modèl
2 CONC es. Mais la nature du matériau 'disponible et la rareté de certains moyen
2 CONC s empêchaient souvent l' architecte de faire valoir son talent. La constr
2 CONC uction à Québec durant cette période ne peut donc s'évaluer en termes d
2 CONC e personnalités et de réalisations grandioses; elle est surtout le résult
2 CONC at d'apports multiples  Une multitude d'artisans s'acharnèrent avec des m

2 CONC seigneur de Mingan, né à Québec le 19 mai 1673 de François Byssot de La R
2 CONC ivière et de Marie Couillard, mort au même endroit le 11 décembre 1737.
2 CONT François-Joseph Bissot nous est surtout connu par ses efforts pour mettr
2 CONC e en valeur la concession de Mingan que son père avait reçue de la Compag
2 CONC nie des Cent-Associés en 1661 et qui s'étendait de « l'Isle aux OEufs [ .
2 CONC .. ]jusqu'aux Sept Isles et dans la Grande Anse, vers les Esquimaux où le
2 CONC s Espagnols font ordinairement la pesche ». Le 9 novembre 1695, il form
2 CONC e une société avec Louis Jolliet et la femme de ce dernier, Claire-Franço
2 CONC ise Bissot, Charles Jolliet et Charles-François Bissot, pour faire du com
2 CONC merce à Mingan pendant cinq ans, mais dès l'année suivante Jolliet y oeuv
2 CONC re seul.
2 CONT Bissot passe néanmoins plusieurs années à Mingan : au moins deux de se
2 CONC s enfants y naissent en 1716 et 1718. Il fait la chasse aux phoques et l
2 CONC a traite avec les Indiens, s'efforçant, comme il le soulignera plus tar
2 CONC d au ministre, de les rejoindre à 100 milles à l'intérieur des terres e
2 CONC t de les empêcher de commercer avec la Hudson's Bay Company. Entre ces sé
2 CONC jours plus ou moins longs il réside à Québec où il se retire définitiveme
2 CONC nt à partir de 1733.
2 CONT Cette année-là, François-Joseph Bissot donne Mingan à bail à son gendr
2 CONC e ' Jean de Lafontaine de Belcour, mais le contrat signé le 29 avril es
2 CONC t résilié dès le 13 septembre suivant. Le 14 septembre 1734 il Joue cett
2 CONC e concession pour deux ans aux sieur; Fleury de La Gorgendière et Trottie
2 CONC r Desauniers. Enfin, par un contrat signé le 15 mars 1736, il l'afferme p
2 CONC our neuf ans à Jean-Louis Volant d'Haudebourg qui devra lui verser 1200
2 CONC # chaque année.
2 CONT A partir de 1733, il multiplie les démarches pour faire confirmer ses ti
2 CONC tres de propriété. Ayant perdu les documents dans un incendie et craignan
2 CONC t que ses terres retombent dans le Domaine du roi, il écrit une premièr
2 CONC e fois à Maurepas pour expliquer le travail qu'il a accompli à Mingan e
2 CONC t les dépenses qu'il a effectuées. Comme il ne reçoit pas de réponse, i
2 CONC l lui écrit de nouveau en 1737. Le ministre demande cette fois à Beauharn
2 CONC ois et à Hocquart de faire les enquêtes et recommandations nécessaires, m
2 CONC ais il est trop tard car Bissot est déjà mort quand la lettre arrive en N
2 CONC ouvelle-France.
2 CONT Les autres activités de François-Joseph Bissot sont assez peu connues. E
2 CONC n 1731, de concert avec le conseiller Martin Chéron, il sollicite l'autor
2 CONC isation de draguer les ancres perdues dans la rade de Québec; comme il pr
2 CONC évoit des dépenses assez fortes, il demande d'être libéré des droits à pa
2 CONC yer, ce qu'appuient: Beauharnois et Hocquart dans leur lettre au ministr
2 CONC e le 24 octobre 1731. Nous connaissons deux procès intentés par Bisso
2 CONC t : l'un, en 1729, contre la fabrique de Québec au sujet d'un banc dans l
2 CONC a cathédrale, l'autre contre Jacques Pinguet de Vaucour, navigateur.
2 CONT Marié le 4 février 1698 à Marie Lambert Dumont, François-Joseph Bissot e
2 CONC ut neuf enfants, soit six filles et trois garçons. Il mourut à Québec l

2 CONT         Suisse de naissance, Miville vint au Canada par La Rochelle à un
2 CONC e date incertaine, mais antérieure au 28 octobre 1649, jour où il reçut d
2 CONC u gouverneur Louis dAilleboust, en même temps que son fils François, un
2 CONC e concession de terre (élevée plus tard au rang darrière-fief) dans la s
2 CONC eigneurie de Lauson. Miville semble avoir essayé dattirer quelques-uns d
2 CONC e ses compatriotes au Canada. En effet, le 16 juillet 1665, M. de Prouvil
2 CONC le de Tracy lui accordait, ainsi quà ses fils et à quatre autres individ
2 CONC us, une concession de 21 arpents par 40, à la Grande Anse (La Pocatière)
2 CONC , dénommant lendroit « Canton des Suisses Fribourgeois ». Cette entrepri
2 CONC se neut pas de succès. Pierre Miville demeura à Lauson jusquà sa mort
2 CONC , le 14 octobre 1669. Il avait épousé en France Charlotte Maugis, qui lu
2 CONC i donna au moins six enfants ; lun deux, Jacques, a été la souche des f
2 CONC amilles Miville-Deschênes de lAmérique du Nord.

1 NOTE interprete et commis de la Compagnie des Cent-Associés, agent de liaiso
2 CONC n entre les Français et les Indiens, explorateur, né vers 1598, probablem
2 CONC ent à Cherbourg à Cherbourg (Normandie), de Thomas Nicollet, messager pos
2 CONC tal ordinaire du roi entre Cherbourg et Paris, et de Marie de Lamer, noy
2 CONC é près de Sillery le 27 octobre 1642.
2 CONT Nicollet arriva au Canada en 1618, au service de la Compagnie des Marcha
2 CONC nds de Rouen et de Saint-Malo. Comme Marsolet et Brùlé, On le destinai
2 CONC t à vivre parmi les Indiens alliés afin qu'il apprît leur langue, leurs c
2 CONC outumes et explorât les régions qu'ils habitaient. On ne sait rien de so
2 CONC n éducation ni de son tempérament, sauf cette remarque du père Vimont, e
2 CONC n 1643 : « son humeur & sa mémoire excellente firent espérer quelque chos
2 CONC e de bon de luy ».
2 CONT Champlain, lors de ses explorations, était entré en relations avec les A
2 CONC lgonquins de l'Outaouais (Ottawa) supérieur. On présume que, désireux d
2 CONC e consolider une alliance à peine ébauchée, c'est lui qui chargea Nicolle
2 CONC t, l'année de son arrivée, de se rendre hiverner à l'île aux Allumettes
2 CONC . Cet endroit était le centre de ralliement de la grande famille algonqui
2 CONC ne commandée par Tessouat (mort en 1636). L'île était située en un lieu s
2 CONC tratégique sur l'Outaouais, la route des fourrures. Il importait, dans l'
2 CONC intérêt du commerce, que les tribus qui vivaient sur les bords de l'Outao
2 CONC uais fussent amies des Français. Nicollet resta deux ans à l'île aux Allu
2 CONC mettes, s'acquittant fort bien de sa mission. Il apprit le huron et l'alg
2 CONC onquin, vécut la vie précaire des indigènes, s'initia à leurs coutumes e
2 CONC t explora la région. Les Algonquins ne tardèrent pas à le considérer comm
2 CONC e l'un des leurs. Ils le firent capitaine, lui permirent d'assister à leu
2 CONC rs conseils et l'emmenèrent même chez les Iroquois négocier un traité d
2 CONC e paix.
2 CONT Nicollet revint à Québec en 1620. Il rendit compte de sa mission et en r
2 CONC eçut une nouvelle : entrer en rapport avec les Népissingues qui vivaien
2 CONC t sur les bords du lac du même nom. Ces indiens occupaient chaque année u
2 CONC ne place plus importante dans le commerce des fourrures, se posant en int
2 CONC ermédiaires entre les Français et les tribus indiennes de l'Ouest et de l
2 CONC a baie d'Hudson. Nicollet devait consolider leur alliance avec les França
2 CONC is et veiller à ce que leurs fourrures ne prennent pas la route de l'Huds
2 CONC on.
2 CONT Dès l'été 1620, Nicollet se rendit chez les Népissingues. Neuf années du
2 CONC rant, il allait vivre parmi eux. Il avait sa cabane à part et un magasin
2 CONC . Le jour, il commerçait avec les Indiens des différentes tribus qui se r
2 CONC endaient sur les bords du lac des Népissingues (Nipissing) et les interro
2 CONC geait sur leur pays ; le soir, il notait par écrit ce qu'il avait recueil
2 CONC li. Ces mémoires de Nicollet, malheureusement perdus aujourd'hui, nous so
2 CONC nt parvenus indirectement par les Relations. Le père Paul le Jeune, qu
2 CONC i a pu les consulter, s'en inspira pour décrire les moeurs des indiens d
2 CONC e cette région.
2 CONT Lors de la prise de Québec par les Anglais en 1629, Nicollet, fidèle à l
2 CONC a France, se réfugia au pays des Hurons. Il contrecarra tous les plans de
2 CONC s Anglais pour amener les Indiens à commercer avec eux.
2 CONT Nicollet parut à Trois-Rivières et à Québec en 1633. Il demanda la permi
2 CONC ssion de s'établir à Trois-Rivières à titre de commis de la Compagnie de
2 CONC s Cent-Associés. On accéda volontiers à son désir. Cependant, avant d'ass
2 CONC umer ses nouvelles fonctions, il fut prié, sans doute par Champlain, d'en
2 CONC treprendre un voyage d'exploration et de pacification chez les Gens de Me
2 CONC r, appelés aussi Puants, Ounipigons ou Winnebagoes. Ces Indiens vivaien
2 CONC t au fond de la baie des Puants (Green Bay), entourés de tribus algonquin
2 CONC es avec qui ils étaient en froid au sujet du commerce des fourrures Une a
2 CONC lliance entre les Gens de Mer et les Hollandais de l'Hudson était à crain
2 CONC dre. Il fallait rétablir la paix au plus tôt dans cette région. Nicolle
2 CONC t devait en profiter aussi pour vérifier les renseignements qu'il avait r
2 CONC ecueillis concernant la mer de Chine qui, selon les Indiens, était à prox
2 CONC imité de la baie des Puants. Aussi Nicollet se munit-il, avant son départ
2 CONC , d'une robe de damas de Chine, toute parsemée de fleurs et d'oiseaux mul
2 CONC ticolores.
2 CONT Nicollet se mit en route durant l'été de 1634, probablement à la mi-juil
2 CONC let. Il suivit la route traditionnelle de l'Outaouais, bifurqua à l'île a
2 CONC ux Allumettes en direction du lac des Népissingues puis descendit la rivi
2 CONC ère des Français pour atteindre le lac des Hurons. Chemin faisant, il rec
2 CONC ruta une escorte de sept Hurons. Il se dirigea vers Michillimakînac, péné
2 CONC tra dans le lac Michigan et atteignit la baie des Puants. Revêtu de sa ro
2 CONC be de damas, il sema un moment l'épouvante parmi les Winnebagoes, qui l
2 CONC e prirent pour un dieu. Il réunit 4 000 ou 5 000 hommes, groupant les dif
2 CONC férentes tribus de J'endroit qui, dans la fumée des calumets, concluren
2 CONC t la paix.
2 CONT Nicollet avait atteint le premier objectif de son voyage. Malheureusemen
2 CONC t, il-n'avait pas trouvé la mer de Chine. En vain descendit-il la rivièr
2 CONC e aux Renards jusqu'à un village de Mascoutens, situé à trois jours de l
2 CONC a rivière Wisconsin, affluent du Mississipi. Une percée vers le Sud, en d
2 CONC irection de la rivière des Minois, ne fut guère plus fructueuse. Sans dou
2 CONC te déçu du succès partiel de sa mission, il revint à Québec à l'automne d
2 CONC e 1635. Il n'en reste pas moins qu'il fut le premier Blanc à explorer l
2 CONC a région du Nord-Ouest américain actuel.
2 CONT Nicollet s'installa définitivement à TroisRivières, en qualité de commi
2 CONC s de la Compagnie des Cent-Associés. Il reçut une « concession de 160 arp
2 CONC ents de bois en commun avec Olivier Letardif dans la banlieue le 23 mai 1
2 CONC 637 ». Ce serait à la meme époque qu'il aurait obtenu, en copropriété ave
2 CONC c son beau-frère Letardif, le fief de Belleborne, situé probablement dan
2 CONC s les plaines d'Abraham, à Québec. Il épousa, en octobre 1637, Marguerite
2 CONC , fille de Guillaume Couillard et de Guillemette Hébert, qui lui donna u
2 CONC n garçon et une fille. Cette dernière, prénommée Marguerite, devint la fe
2 CONC mme de Jean-Baptiste Legardeur de Repentigny, membre du Conseil souverain
2 CONC . Jusqu'à sa mort, Nicollet apparaît comme une figure dominante du bour
2 CONC g de Trois-Rivières. Les services signalés qu'il a rendus à la colonie, s
2 CONC a connaissance des langues et des coutumes indiennes lui valurent le resp
2 CONC ect de tous.
2 CONT Les Relations des Jésuites font souvent l'éloge de sa conduite exemplair
2 CONC e : à l'encontre de la plupart des coureurs de bois de son temps, Nicolle
2 CONC t aurait toujours vécu suivant les principes de sa religion. Pourtant, i
2 CONC l eut en 1628 une fille naturelle née probablement d'une Népissingue. E
2 CONC n 1633, il demanda à rester à Trois-Rivières, « pour mettre, rapporte l
2 CONC e père Le Jeune, son salut en assurance dans l'usage des sacrements ». S
2 CONC a plus grande joie, dans les moments de loisirs que lui laissaient ses fo
2 CONC nctions, était de servir d'interprète aux missionnaires et d'enseigner l
2 CONC a religion aux Indiens.
2 CONT Nicollet mourut prématurément à Québec en 1642. Il remplaçait temporaire
2 CONC ment le commis général de la compagnie, son beau-frère Letardif, quand o
2 CONC n lui demanda de se rendre au plus tôt à Trois-Rivières pour délivrer u
2 CONC n prisonnier iroquois que les Hurons s'apprêtaient à torturer. La chaloup
2 CONC e qui le transportait vers Trois-Rivières fut renversée par un fort cou
2 CONC p de vent, près de Sillery. Ne sachant pas nager, il se noya.

1 NOTE AMIOT (Amyot), dit Villeneuve, MATHIEU, donné, interprète, seigneur, né e
2 CONC ntre 1627 et 1629. probablement près de Chartres (Orléanais), de Philipp
2 CONC e Amiot et dAnne Convent, décédé à Québec le 18 novembre 1688.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Originaire des environs de Soissons, son père était à Québec dès l
2 CONC été de 1635. Mathieu, comme son frère Jean, fut pendant quelques année
2 CONC s interprète des Jésuites, travaillant chez eux à Trois-Rivières et peut-
2 CONC être aussi en Huronie. Puis il se fit colon et réussit pendant le reste d
2 CONC e sa vie à accumuler un nombre assez intéressant de possessions. Ainsi, e
2 CONC n 1649, le gouverneur LouIs dAilleboust lui concéda une terre à Trois-Ri
2 CONC vières ; en outre, lors de son mariage, le 22 octobre 1650, Marie Mivill
2 CONC e lui apporta en dot une propriété dans la ville de Québec ; en 1661, le
2 CONC s Jésuites lui firent concession dun lot à Sillery, où il se construisi
2 CONC t une maison, tout en conservant sa demeure en ville ; le 6 septembre 166
2 CONC 5, Jean Juchereau de Maur lui donna, sur la Pointe-Villeneuve, près de Sa
2 CONC int-Augustin de Portneuf, une propriété quil agrandit en 1677 et en 168
2 CONC 5 ; le 3 novembre 1672, Talon lui avait concédé en fief et seigneurie u
2 CONC n autre domaine à la Pointe-aux-Bouleaux.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       À mesure que ses biens saccumulaient, Mathieu devenait un personn
2 CONC age de plus en plus important dans la colonie. Comme notable, à Québec, i
2 CONC l avait participé à lélection dun syndic en 1664 et, trois ans plus tar
2 CONC d, le roi agréa la requête de Talon de lui octroyer des lettres de nobles
2 CONC se. Cependant, quand elles arrivèrent, en 1668, lintendant ignorait si
2 CONC l devait les faire enregistrer au Conseil souverain de Québec ou au parle
2 CONC ment de Paris. En attendant la réponse de Versailles, il apprit que Loui
2 CONC s XIV avait aboli tous les titres non encore enregistrés (1669). Trois au
2 CONC tres colons avaient reçu des lettres de noblesse en même temps quAmiot
2 CONC . Eux ou leurs descendants les firent reconnaître en dépit de lordonnanc
2 CONC e de 1669. Amiot nayant fait aucune revendication au sujet des siennes
2 CONC , semble-t-il, elles furent définitivement annulées.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Villeneuve laissa à ses héritiers plus de dettes et de soucis qu
2 CONC e de biens. En 1703, les dettes de la succession sélevaient encore à 700
2 CONC ª et Marie Miville, qui avait vendu les terres pour 1 500ª, était morte (
2 CONC septembre 1702) des angoisses que lui causait un procès intenté contre el
2 CONC le par son fils Charles, laîné de ses 15 enfants.

2 NOTE Subject: Descendants of Angus (Gillis) MacDonald, Morar, Inverness-shire
3 CONC , Scotland and his wife, Elizabeth Grant.
3 CONT In St. Andrew's Cemetery, Egerton are two gravestones, side by side, clo
3 CONC se to the place where the Catholic Church stood during the early years o
3 CONC f the 19th century. On one stone is "In memory of Angus McDonald of Frenc
3 CONC h River. Died August 9, 1835, aged 80. Cairid na chiad Gaeil a thainigI
3 CONC n duthch". On the other stone is "In memory of Elizabeth Grant, spouse t
3 CONC o Angus McDonald, departed this life April 18, 1825, aged 67 years". Sh
3 CONC e was the daughter of Peter Grant, Little Harbour.
3 CONT Angus "Pioneer" MacDonald came to Prince Edward Island (then Saint John'
3 CONC s Island) with John MacDonald of Glenaladale, a Clanranald chieftain, i
3 CONC n the early 1770ts. With his chieftain he fought against the American inv
3 CONC aders who attacked Quebec in 1775.
3 CONT Angus "Pioneer" and his brother John (Ban) Gillis settled in Arisaig. Bu
3 CONC t Angus soon moved west,-taking up a lot of land on Merigomish Harbour, i
3 CONC n what is now Egerton. The home of Angus and Elizabeth became a stoppin
3 CONC g point for many travellers making the journey between Pictou and the ne
3 CONC w settlements in Antigonish and Cape Breton. This is the reason for the G
3 CONC aelic inscription on Angus's gravestone: "friend of the first Highlander
3 CONC s who came to the country". Family tradition has it that Father (later Bi
3 CONC shop) Angus B. MacEachern and Father Vincent de Paul the Trappist mission
3 CONC ary enjoyed the MacDonald hospitality.
3 CONT We know of seven children born to Angus and Elizabeth:
3 CONT (1)Mrs. MacNeil (Anne)
3 CONT (2)John
3 CONT (3)Angus (Squire)
3 CONT (4)Donald
3 CONT (5)Peter (Paddy)
3 CONT (6)Mrs. MacK. (?)
3 CONT (7)Jane - Mrs. "Pilot" MacDonald, Pictou
3 CONT Explanations:
3 CONT (2)John had 13 children; his wife was a Chisholm.
3 CONT (3)"Squire" Angus, so-called because he was a Justice of the Peace, wa
3 CONC s killed in 1850 in an accident on the Albion Mines Railway. He was marri
3 CONC ed twice, both times to MacDonalds from Little Harbour.
3 CONT (4)Donald was married to Catherine MacDonald. They had four sons, two d
3 CONC aughters - Donald, "Big Angus", Paddy, John (Custos), Annie and Elizabeth
3 CONC . A descendant of this union, Donald "Point Betty", brought up a large fa
3 CONC mily on Point Betty Island in Merigomish Harbour. His daughter Katherin
3 CONC e is the family historian. Donald's son "Big Angus" married Eunice MacLeo
3 CONC d. A son, Father W.B. MacDonald, was long-time pastor of Lourdes Parish i
3 CONC n Pictou County. Another descendant of "Big Angus" was Angus "Printer" Ma
3 CONC cDonald of Egerton and New Glasgow. Angus "Printer's" first wife was "Squ
3 CONC ire" Angus' grand-daughter. By her he had a number of children: Bernard
3 CONC , Donald, Bertha (Mrs. Bob Beaton, Pictou), Vincent, and others. The "Pri
3 CONC nter's" second wife was Pauline "Blacksmith" MacDonald, they had no child
3 CONC ren. John "Custos" was a public official (Custos Rotulorum) at North Gran
3 CONC t, Antigonish County. Descendants of John "Custos" include the children o
3 CONC f John "Piper" MacDonald (well-known as "Jack the carpenter" at St.F.X. i
3 CONC n the 19401s). John Piper's wife was Catherine Sutton, grand-daughter o
3 CONC f John "Custos". They had 9 children: Robbie, well-known teacher in Antig
3 CONC onish; Hugh A.; J.J.; Frank; Sister Monica, C.N.D.; Mrs. James Hanrahan
3 CONC , and others. A daughter of John "Custos" son Donald was Mrs. "Johnny Jim
3 CONC " Chisholm, Brierly Book. Her son, Dan, retired CN Telegraph foreman, liv
3 CONC ed in New Glasgow. A brother of Mrs. "Johnny Jim", Peter, was drowned i
3 CONC n Massachusetts in 1898. (A lineman, he was splicing a cable under a brid
3 CONC ge over the Concord River.)
3 CONT (5)Peter "Paddy" married a Campbell from Antigonish. 
3 CONT Comments
3 CONT (A)Of the numerous descendants of Angus "Pioneer" and his wife, no on
3 CONC e now (1992) lives in Egerton to carry on the MacDonald name (Katherine
3 CONC , historian, is a summer resident).McCarrons, MacInnises and A.A. MacKenz
3 CONC ie are descendants, but are not MacDonalds. Many of the relatives are i
3 CONC n the United States.
3 CONT (B)Barnabas McGee, Roys, Copelands and others were settled in what is n
3 CONC ow Merigomish before Angus and Elizabeth came to these shores (and Micmac
3 CONC s and Acadian French before any of them). But Angus and Elizabeth were Hi
3 CONC ghland Scotch pioneers in what is now Egerton. The community now called M
3 CONC erigomish was long known as French River. (The ICR railroad station at Me
3 CONC rigomish was called French River Station for some years). Angus lived nea
3 CONC r the mouth of Sutherland's River, and is known to some descendants as "A
3 CONC ngus the River".
3 CONT (C)We might note the large number of nicknames - "Squire" Angus; "Widow
3 CONC 's Angus" (also called "Cabbage Angus"); "John California"; "Sandy the Ca
3 CONC ulker"; Donald "Blacksmith"; Donald "Point-Betty"; "Old Young John"; "Ol
3 CONC d Young John"s Big Johnny's John"; Angus "Paddy"s" Allan; Jimmy "Island J
3 CONC ohn" - his father was from Prince Edward Island; Katie from the Ponds; An
3 CONC gus "Governor"; Angus "Jimmy Dan"; and there are others.
3 CONT (D)There were many second marriages - usually of widowers. It was a har
3 CONC d life for women. One branch of the family had so many daughters marry wi
3 CONC dowers that my grandmother - Janet (McVicar) MacEachen and her sister-in-
3 CONC law -- Catherine (Grant) McVicar wished to put a large sign at the gate t
3 CONC o that relative's property: MORE WIDOWERS WANTED. Family pressure stoppe
3 CONC d the project.
3 CONT There was also a considerable amount of intermarriage among cousins.
3 CONT (E)Remarkably little is known yet of Angus "Pioneer's" three daughter
3 CONC s and their descendants.
3 CONT There may also have been another son of the pioneer -Alex.
3 CONT (F)How did Angus "Pioneer" come to change his name to MacDonald? Severa
3 CONC l sources suggest that he did it out of gratitude to his chieftain, MacDo
3 CONC nald of Glenaladale. But "Squire" Angus grand-daughters, Rachel and Dolen
3 CONC a MacDonald, had an explanation received from their father. A Gillis woma
3 CONC n from Morar married one of the MacIan MacDonaldfs from Glencoe, and live
3 CONC d in Glencoe. She escaped the Massacre perpetrated by the Campbells unde
3 CONC r English orders in 1692. Her husband was killed, but she made her way ho
3 CONC me over the mountains to Morar carrying their child. Living with her pare
3 CONC nts, she brought up the child as a Gillis, fearing Campbell vengeance o
3 CONC n a survivor of the Massacre. When Angus "Pioneer" settled in America nea
3 CONC rly a century later he took back the proper name of MacDonald which his a
3 CONC ncestor had abandoned.

2 NOTE The home of this family of the MacLeods was in a pretty place called Clia
3 CONC dal on the west side of Eigg. The MacLeods of Cliadal were the oldest fam
3 CONC ily in Eigg, for they were the only family that escaped destruction at th
3 CONC e time the Clanranald MacDonalds weresmothered to death in Uamha Raing b
3 CONC y the MacLeods. A sister of the chief of the MacLeods was married to Clan
3 CONC ranald. The old people speak of her as the "beautiful woman" but she wa
3 CONC s mistreated by her husband. Some indignity offered to his people by th
3 CONC e MacDonalds in Eigg added fuel to the flame, and MacLeod sent a force t
3 CONC o punish the MacDonalds of Eigg who, forwarned, took refuge in a large ca
3 CONC ve near the shore. Unfortunately, their presence was discovered and the M
3 CONC acLeods, unable to enter, piled up a mass of combustible matter before th
3 CONC e entrance, and setting it on fire, smothere the helpless MacDonalds to d
3 CONC eath. The MacLeods of Cliadal took refuge in another cave and thus escape
3 CONC d the catastrophe that cut off the rest of the natives.

2 NOTE Very Sad News.--Last week a letter was received by Rev. Father McKenzie o
3 CONC f Arisaig from Alexander Ross at Portland, Oregon, giving the sad news o
3 CONC f the drowning in Alaska waters of the writer's brother, Andrew Ross, an
3 CONC d his wife, who about three months ago left their former comfortable hom
3 CONC e at Arisaig for the West. Mr. Ross had gone to the Pacific with the inte
3 CONC ntion of engaging in business, having some years ago lived in the State
3 CONC s of Washington and Oregon. After reaching the Coast he visited several o
3 CONC f the leading cities of British Columbia and Washington, and finally enga
3 CONC ged with a large mercantile house at Seattle to take charge of an agenc
3 CONC y for them at Skagway, Alaska. Accompanied by his wife he set out for tha
3 CONC t place on a steamer which was wrecked on the Alaskan coast, between For
3 CONC t Wrangel and Skagway a few weeks ago and many of whose passengers perish
3 CONC ed. The profoundest sorrow is expressed on all hands over the sad fate o
3 CONC f this estimable young couple, both of whom were universally admired an
3 CONC d respected. Mr. Ross was a young man of sterling character, always note
3 CONC d for his through honesty and integrity. His aged parents, Mr. and Mrs. D
3 CONC onald Ross, have the sincerest sympathy in their sad affliction. Mrs. Ros
3 CONC s was a daughter of the late Donald McDonald of Avondale, Pictou Co., an
3 CONC d a granddaughter of the late Allan McDonald, of Keppoch, whose death a
3 CONC t the age of 100 was reported last week's Casket. She was educated at Mou
3 CONC nt St. Bernard, here, and was a lady of more than ordinary refinement, an
3 CONC d a great favorite with all her friends. May they rest in peace.

1 NOTE It seems clear from church and census records that the girl registered a
2 CONC s being baptized as 'Lydia Ann' is the girl called 'Sophia' in the 1871 c
2 CONC ensus. But which name is CORRECT?? No date of birth is given at the bapti
2 CONC sm, so I wonder if the record was recorded later, perhaps incorrectly. Un
2 CONC fortunately she is not in the 1881 census, and since Jost indicates tha
2 CONC t the family consisted of only 4 girls and 3 boys, I can only assume tha
2 CONC t Sophia may have died young. I suppose she could have married young an
2 CONC d been forgotten.

1 NOTE Notes from Webb state that Sabina Atwater married to Morgan Connor firs
2 CONC t and 'secondly to a Captain Wentworth and had a daughter named Mary wh
2 CONC o married a Taylor from Pomquet.' But see notes for Sabina and her othe
2 CONC r TWO husbands. I have a note that says she had only a daughter when marr
2 CONC ied to Mr. Dunn, and that this was Tom Taylor's mom, whom I assumed fro
2 CONC m the context would be Tom Taylor of Bayfield, son of Aylward and MARY Ta
2 CONC ylor. In fact, this Mary by census records was b.about 1798 in N.S. [se
2 CONC e Sabina's marriage dates!!].

1 NOTE CORRIVEAU (Corrivaux), MARIE-JOSEPHTE, dite La Corriveau, née à Saint-Val
2 CONC lier, près de Québec, et baptisée le 14 mai 1733, fille de Joseph Corrive
2 CONC au, cultivateur, et de Marie-Françoise Bolduc ; elle épousa en première
2 CONC s noces, le 17 novembre 1749, Charles Bouchard, cultivateur, inhumé le 2
2 CONC 7 avril 1760, de qui elle eut trois enfants, et en secondes noces, le 2

2 CONT 
2 CONT       Il nest guère de femme, dans toute lhistoire canadienne, qui ai
2 CONC t plus mauvaise réputation que Marie-Josephte Corriveau, appelée communém
2 CONC ent La Corriveau. Cette malheureuse est morte voilà plus de deux siècles
2 CONC , mais elle continue de hanter les imaginations. On parle encore delle
2 CONC , de son crime réel et de ses crimes fictifs. Le 15 avril 1763, elle fu
2 CONC t condamnée à mort par une cour martiale pour le meurtre de Louis Dodier
2 CONC , son second mari, survenu dans la nuit du 26 au 27 janvier 1763. Cet ass
2 CONC assinat donna lieu à deux procès retentissants devant un tribunal militai
2 CONC re qui se réunit dans une des salles du monastère des ursulines de Québe
2 CONC c et qui était composé de 12 officiers anglais et présidé par le lieutena
2 CONC nt-colonel Roger Morris. Les procès-verbaux de ces procès, retrouvés en 1
2 CONC 947 à Londres, permettent détablir les faits très exactement et de les d
2 CONC égager de la légende qui les entoura par la suite.

2 CONC définiment exposé dans les « chaînes », en conformité avec la loi anglais
2 CONC e (Statutes United Kingdom, 25, George II, 1752). Lexécution eut lieu su

2 CONT       Tous ces faits inusités et dautres, comme la découverte de la cag

2 CONT Sa présence dans la colonie est signalée pour la première fois à la pris

2 CONT Établi par la suite à la Pointe-Lévy, sur la côte de Lauson, Byssot s'as

2 CONC , défricha un terrain et construisit un corps de logis tandis que Bysso
2 CONC t fournissait l'argent et les matériaux. Cette propriété avait 40 arpent
2 CONC s de profondeur sur 5, en bordure du Saint-Laurent. Le 15 octobre 1648, J
2 CONC ean De Lauson (père) signa, à Paris, un titre régulier à ses deux premier
2 CONC s censitaires, Byssot et Couture. A Québec, dix jours plus tard, Byssot
2 CONC , âgé de 34 ans, épouse Marie Couillard, cinquième enfant de Guillaume Co
2 CONC uillard et de Guillemette Hébert. Le 9 août 1653, il fut nommé adjoint da
2 CONC ns le corps des syndics de. Québec pour y représenter la côte de Lauson
2 CONC . En 1655, il fit construire un moulin pour les colons à la Pointe-Lévy
2 CONC . Prenant part à l'organisation de la justice seigneuriale, il devint pro

2 CONT Pour fins de chasse et de pêche, le 25 février 1661, Byssot reçut de l

2 CONC s de la Communauté obtinrent de Pierre Dubois Davaugour la « Traicte de T
2 CONC adoussacq » pour deux ans, mais le nouveau gouverneur, Saffray de Mézy, c
2 CONC assa dès le 4 octobre, le bail établi par son prédécesseur.
2 CONT Le 8 mars 1664, d'après J.-E. Roy, Lauson donna à Byssot une nouvelle co
2 CONC ncession pour services rendus ; ce domaine avait une superficie de 400 ar
2 CONC pents. Au départ de Charles De Lauson, de concert avec Eustache Lambert
2 CONC , Byssot prit la seigneurie à ferme. A la Pointe-Lévy, il construisit, e
2 CONC n 1668, la première tannerie de la colonie, sur le terrain qu'il avait re
2 CONC çu en 1648. On construisit une écluse dans le ruisseau séparant son domai
2 CONC ne de celui de Couture : un canal de bois conduisait l'eau dans les cuve
2 CONC s à tanin. L'intendant TALON avança 3 268# pour l'entreprise, tandis qu
2 CONC e la Compagnie des Indes occidentales en allouait 1500. On se spécialis
2 CONC a dans le tannage des peaux de vaches, de veaux, de marsouins, qui servai
2 CONC ent à la confection de souliers, de bottines, de manchons et de housses p
2 CONC our coffres et malles. Fait à signaler, à l'inventaire de ses biens, dres
2 CONC sé après sa mort, on ne trouve pas une seule peau de phoque.
2 CONT En 1671, Byssot s'adressa à Talon et obtint, de concert avec Nicolas Juc
2 CONC hereau de SaintDenis, « des concessions pour la pesche de molues et de lo
2 CONC ups marins, et pour les huisles », mais ses succès dans le domaine des pê
2 CONC cheries demeurent inconnus.
2 CONT Le 3 novembre 1672, il reçut en concession la seigneurie de Vincennes, d
2 CONC omaine de 70 arpents par une lieue, qu'il enregistra au nom de ses fils C
2 CONC harles-François et Jean-Baptiste. Le fils de ce dernier, François-Marie
2 CONC , fut le fondateur du poste de Vincennes, dans l'Indiana. Byssot eut 12 e
2 CONC nfants ; une de ses filles, Claire-Françoise, épousa Louis Jolliet. Il mo
2 CONC urut à Québec le 26 juillet 1673.
2 CONT Sa veuve, Marie Couillard, se remaria en 1675 avec Jacques de Lalande d
2 CONC e Gayon. En octobre 1690, elle fut faite prisonnière par les Anglais et g
2 CONC ardée sur le vaisseau amiral de Phips. Celui-ci la renvoya à Québec à l
2 CONC a veille de son départ pour proposer un échange des prisonniers entre le
2 CONC s deux camps.

1 NOTE After having lost his child-wife, Isabelle of Flanders, he went on crusad
2 CONC e, then hurried back to marry again for the sake of his dynasty as his so
2 CONC n, Louis, was a sickly child. What he needed was the daughter of a king a
2 CONC nd, on 14 August 1193, he married Ingeborg (Isambour), daughter of King V
2 CONC aldemar of Denmark. Arrangements had been made for her to be crowned quee
2 CONC n the day after the nuptials but, during the wedding night, Philippe's fe
2 CONC elings changed to repulsion.  In Compiègne, before an assembly, fifteen d
2 CONC uly sworn witnesses, twelve of them from the king's family, solemnly calc
2 CONC ulated the degrees of consanguinity and showed that Philippe and Ingebor
2 CONC g were fourth cousins, a prohibiting degree for marriage. However, this s
2 CONC olution was not accepted by Ingeborg's brother, the Danish king, who appe
2 CONC aled to Pope Celestine III, claiming the genealogies to be wrong, but th
2 CONC e pope gave Philippe no more than a warning.   In June 1196, Philippe II
2 CONC I married the beautiful Agnès de Meran. With Ingeborg still alive, this w
2 CONC as bigamy. The new pope, Innocent III, ordered Philippe to part from Agnè
2 CONC s and, laying France under an interdict, wanted to suspend all religiou
2 CONC s services. Negotiations were to last fifteen years and, because of the C
2 CONC athar upsurge, the  interdict was not applied.    In 1201 in Soissons, th
2 CONC e church confronted Philippe but, after a fortnight's arguing, he departe
2 CONC d, taking Ingeborg with him. On 29 July 1201 Agnès de Meran died and Phil
2 CONC ippe could no longer be regarded as a bigamist; and so, in November of th
2 CONC at year, the pope legitimised the two children of Philippe and Agnès. I
2 CONC n 1205 a 'damsel from Arras' bore him a bastard son and, as Philippe woul
2 CONC d have nothing to do with Ingeborg, she was spared the perils of childbea
2 CONC ring.  As it had not been consummated, the pope was willing to declare th
2 CONC e marriage with Ingeborg void. However, they had not counted on Ingebor
2 CONC g who maintained that she and Philippe had slept together. To satisfy pop
2 CONC e, king and queen, the only solution seemed to be that the queen should t
2 CONC ake the veil and enter a convent; but then, in April 1213, Philippe annou
2 CONC nced he was taking back his wife.

1 NOTE King Louis VII of France was in urgent need of a son and heir as his firs
2 CONC t two wives, Eleonore de Poitou and Constance of Castile, had made him th
2 CONC e father of only four girls. And so, on 13 November 1160, only a month af
2 CONC ter the death of his second wife, he married Alix de Blois. In 1165 she b
2 CONC ecame the mother of a son, Philippe II August, later to be followed by tw
2 CONC o more daughters. In 1180, Louis VII died, making the 15-year-old Philipp
2 CONC e II king of an area little larger than the Ile de France. Perhaps this w
2 CONC as the reason why he took some of his mother's castles, causing a quarrel
2 CONC . However, these disagreements were settled and, when Philippe II went o
2 CONC n crusade (1190-1191), she acted as his Regent.

1 NOTE In 1131, at the age of eleven, he was anointed as his father's successor
2 CONC ; and when his father died in 1137 he became sole ruler of France. In th
2 CONC e same year he married Eleanore de Poitou, Duchess of Aquitaine, so exten
2 CONC ding the Capetingian lands to the Pyrenees. He continued his father's pro
2 CONC gram of appointing trustworthy people of lower origin to the administrati
2 CONC on of his government, thus improving the prestige of the monarchy. From 1
2 CONC 141 to 1143 he was involved in a fruitless conflict with Thibaut, Count o
2 CONC f Champagne, and the papacy. After this period his relations with the pop
2 CONC es improved to such an extent that he supported Pope Alexander II agains
2 CONC t Frederick Barbarossa and even allowed the pope refuge in France. Howeve
2 CONC r, the main threats to his kingdom came from Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, an
2 CONC d later from Geoffrey's son, the future Henry II, King of England. When L
2 CONC ouis VII went on crusade, he took his wife with him. However, on their re
2 CONC turn he divorced her, the grounds officially being consanguinity, but th
2 CONC e reasons were her rumoured affairs. Almost immediately she married Kin
2 CONC g Henry II of England, taking Aquitaine with her. Louis VII then marrie
2 CONC d Constance of Castile and, when she died, he married Alix de Champagne w
2 CONC ho became the mother of his son and heir, the future King Philippe II Aug
2 CONC ust. Louis VII might have defeated King Henry II had he made a concerte
2 CONC d attack instead of the half-hearted attacks on Normandy, while at the sa
2 CONC me time France was spared attacks from the Anglo-Normans because of thei
2 CONC r internal quarrels. He also benefited from the long-standing quarrel bet
2 CONC ween Henry II and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, and a revolt o
2 CONC f Henry's sons.  @ M  k  EAlix de Blois-Champagne  F  E(1140-1206), Pag
2 CONC e 2.  F King Louis VII of France was in urgent need of a son and heir a
2 CONC s his first two wives, Eleonore de Poitou and Constance of Castile, had m
2 CONC ade him the father of only four girls. And so, on 13 November 1160, onl
2 CONC y a month after the death of his second wife, he married Alix de Blois. I
2 CONC n 1165 she became the mother of a son, Philippe II August, later to be fo
2 CONC llowed by two more daughters. In 1180, Louis VII died, making the 15-year
2 CONC -old Philippe II king of an area little larger than the Ile de France. Pe
2 CONC rhaps this was the reason why he took some of his mother's castles, causi
2 CONC ng a quarrel. However, these disagreements were settled and, when Philipp
2 CONC e II went on crusade (1190-1191), she acted as his Regent.

1 NOTE At age twenty, Philippe I, King of France, married Bertha of Holland, th
2 CONC e step-daughter of his first cousin. This marriage had been arranged to s
2 CONC eal the reconciliation between the king and his first cousin, the Count o
2 CONC f Flanders. However, it took Bertha about six years before she produce
2 CONC d a daughter, Constance, which was not the hoped-for heir. Arnoul, a hol
2 CONC y hermit of Saint-Médard in Soissons who was always consulted on family p
2 CONC roblems, prayed to heaven; however, it still took another three years bef
2 CONC ore the heir, the future King Louis VI, was born. He was followed by thre
2 CONC e more sons. Twenty years after the marriage, Philippe imprisoned Berth
2 CONC a in comfort in the château at Montreuil-sur-Mer. He then wed the still
2 CONC - married Bertrade de Montfort l'Amauri, wife of the Count of Anjou, an
2 CONC d they produced four children. It is lost in time whether she seduced hi
2 CONC m or he her, but most likely Philippe had an understanding with the Coun
2 CONC t of Anjou. In any case Betrade was more than willing as she did not wan
2 CONC t to be "sent away like a whore," as her husband had done to her predeces
2 CONC sors. Philippe's remarriage caused a sensation but not disapproval. The o
2 CONC nly one who caused problems was Yves, bishop of Chartres, who had been ap
2 CONC pointed by Pope Urban II without consultations with Philippe and this ha
2 CONC d been resented by the latter. The king had invited all bishops to his se
2 CONC cond wedding but Yves declined, referring to Philippe as committing bigam
2 CONC y. Although Philippe had married with the blessing of the Archbishop of R
2 CONC eims as well as the Papal legate, Yves wrote to the Pope who then forbad
2 CONC e the bishops to crown Bertrade and told Philippe to cease all relation
2 CONC s with her or else be excommunicated. Next, Bertha, his first wife, die
2 CONC d and Philippe gathered two archbishops and eight bishops in Reims who al
2 CONC l confirmed the royal second marriage. The Pope also put pressure on th
2 CONC e womanising Count of Anjou who then obediently complained about the king
2 CONC 's committing adultery with his wife. In 1096 Philippe pretended to hav
2 CONC e broken with Bertrade and consequently the excommunication was lifted. H
2 CONC owever, when it became obvious in 1099 that Bertrade was still with him
2 CONC , the excommunication was renewed. It took until 1105 before peace was re
2 CONC stored and from then on Philippe and Bertrade remained together till Phil
2 CONC ippe died in 1108.

1 NOTE About 1018 the 'Manichaean' teachings appeared in Aquitaine; this sect no
2 CONC t only rejected both baptism and the Cross but apparently observed stric
2 CONC t asceticism. Ten years later, ten of the canons of the Church of the Hol
2 CONC y Cross at Orléans were accused of being 'Manichaeans' and of worshippin
2 CONC g the devil. These canons, which included the confessor of Queen Constanc
2 CONC e, rejected the sacraments of the Church and denied the human birth of Ch
2 CONC rist together with the reality of his Passion and Resurrection. Brought t
2 CONC o trial before the King, Robert 'the Pious', and an assemblage of bishops
2 CONC , these heretics were consigned to the flames, yet not before Queen Const
2 CONC ance struck out the eye of her former confessor.

1 NOTE King of France and founder of the Capetingian dynasty, he was the eldes
2 CONC t son of Hugues "The Great". When his father died in 956, he succeeded t
2 CONC o his numerous fiefs around Paris and Orlans; and his cousin, the Franki
2 CONC sh king Lothair, recognised him somewhat reluctantly as Duke of the Frank
2 CONC s. Many of the counts in northern France did homage to him as their overl
2 CONC ord, and Richard I, Duke of Normandy, was both his vassal and his brother
2 CONC -in-law. His authority extended over certain districts south of the Loir
2 CONC e and, owing to his interference, Lothair was obliged to recognise his br
2 CONC other Henri as Duke of Burgundy. Hugues Capet supported his royal suzerai
2 CONC n when Lothair and Emperor Otto II fought for the possession of Lorraine
2 CONC ; but chagrined at the king's conduct in making peace in 980, he went t
2 CONC o Rome to conclude an alliance with Otto. Laying more stress upon indepen
2 CONC dence than upon loyalty, Hugues appears to have acted in a haughty manne
2 CONC r toward Lothair, and also towards his son and successor, Louis V. Howeve
2 CONC r, neither king was strong enough to punish this powerful vassal. When Lo
2 CONC uis V died without children in May 987, both Hugues and the late king's u
2 CONC ncle, Charles, Duke of Lorraine, were candidates for the vacant throne, a
2 CONC nd in this contest the energy of Hugues's champions Adelberon, Archbisho
2 CONC p of Reims, and Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II, prevailed. Declari
2 CONC ng the Frankish crown to be an elective and not an hereditary dignity, Ad
2 CONC elberon secured the election of his friend and crowned him, probably at N
2 CONC oyon, in July 987. Charles of Lorraine was not prepared to bow before hi
2 CONC s successful rival and, before Hugues had secured the coronation of his s
2 CONC on Robert as his collegue and successor in December 987, he found allie
2 CONC s and attacked the king. Hugues was worsted during the earlier part of th
2 CONC e struggle and was in serious straits until he was saved by the wiles o
2 CONC f his partisan, Adelberon, who, in 991, treacherously seized Charles an
2 CONC d handed him over to the king. This capture virtually ended the wars, bu
2 CONC t one of its side issues was a quarrel between Hugues and Pope John XV, w
2 CONC ho was supported by the empire, then under the rule of the Empresses Adel
2 CONC aide and Theophano as regents for the young Emperor Otto III. The origi
2 CONC n of Hugues's name of Capet, which was also applied to his father, has be
2 CONC en the subject of some discussion. It is derived undoubtedly from the Lat
2 CONC in Capa, or Cappa, 'a cape'; but whether Hugues derived it from the cap
2 CONC e which he wore as Abbot of St. Martin's, or from his youthful and playfu
2 CONC l habit of seizing capes, or from some other cause, is uncertain.

1 REFN Charlemagne (French for Carolus Magnus, or Carlus Magnus ("Charles the Gr
2 CONC eat"); German Karl der Grosse). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The name given by later generations to Charles, King of the Franks, firs
2 CONC t sovereign of the Christian Empire of the West; born 2 April, 742; die
2 CONC d at Aachen, 28 January, 814. Note, however, that the place of his birt
2 CONC h (whether Aachen or Lige) has never been fully ascertained, while the t
2 CONC raditional date has been set one or more years later by recent writers; i
2 CONC f Alcuin is to be interpreted literally the year should be 745. At the ti
2 CONC me of Charles' birth, his father, Pepin the Short, Mayor of the Palace, o
2 CONC f the line of Arnulf, was, theoretically, only the first subject of Child
2 CONC eric III, the last Merovinigian King of the Franks; but this modest titl
2 CONC e implied that real power, military, civil, and even ecclesiastical, of w
2 CONC hich Childeric's crown was only the symbol. It is not certain that Bertra
2 CONC da (or Bertha), the mother of Charlemagne, a daughter of Charibert, Coun
2 CONC t of Laon, was legally married to Pepin until some years later than eithe
2 CONC r 742 or 745. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charlemagne's career led to his acknowledgment by the Holy See as its ch
2 CONC ief protector and coadjutor in temporals, by Constantinople as at least B
2 CONC asileus of the West. This reign, which involved to a greater degree tha
2 CONC n that of any other historical personage the organic development, and sti
2 CONC ll more, the consolidation of Christian Europe, will be sketched in thi
2 CONC s article in the successive periods into which it naturally divides. Th
2 CONC e period of Charlemagne was also an epoch of reform for the Church in Gau
2 CONC l, and of foundation for the Church in Germany, marked, moreover, by an e
2 CONC fflorescence of learning which fructified in the great Christian school
2 CONC s of the twelfth and later centuries. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT To the Fall of Pavia (742-774) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 752, when Charles was a child of not more than ten years, Pepin the S
2 CONC hort had appealed to Pope Zachary to recognize his actual rule with the k
2 CONC ingly title and dignity. The practical effect of this appeal to the Hol
2 CONC y See was the journey of Stephen III across the Alps two years later, fo
2 CONC r the purpose of anointing with the oil of kingship not only Pepin, but a
2 CONC lso his son Charles and a younger son, Carloman. The pope then laid upo
2 CONC n the Christian Franks a precept, under the gravest spiritual penalties
2 CONC , never "to choose their kings from any other family". Primogeniture di
2 CONC d not hold in the Frankish law of succession; the monarchy was elective
2 CONC , though eligibility was limited to the male members of the one privilege
2 CONC d family. Thus, then, at St. Denis on the Seine, in the Kingdom of Neustr
2 CONC ia, on the 28th of July, 754, the house of Arnulf was, by a solemn act o
2 CONC f the supreme pontiff established upon the throne until then nominally oc
2 CONC cupied by the house of Merowig (Merovingians). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles, anointed to the kingly office while yet a mere child, learned t
2 CONC he rudiments of war while still many years short of manhood, accompanyin
2 CONC g his father in several campaigns. This early experience is worth notin
2 CONC g chiefly because it developed in the boy those military virtues which, j
2 CONC oined with his extraordinary physical strength and intense nationalism, m
2 CONC ade him a popular hero of the Franks long before he became their rightfu
2 CONC l ruler. At length, in September, 768, Pepin the Short, foreseeing his en
2 CONC d, made a partition of his dominions between his two sons. Not many day
2 CONC s later the old king passed away. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT To better comprehend the effect of the act of partition under which Char
2 CONC les and Carloman inherited their father's dominions, as well as the whol
2 CONC e subsequent history of Charles' reign, it is to be observed that those d
2 CONC ominions comprised: 
2 CONT 
2 CONT first, Frankland (Frankreich) proper; 
2 CONT secondly, as many as seven more or less self-governing dependencies, pe
2 CONC opled by races of various origins and obeying various codes of law. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Of these two divisions, the former extended, roughly speaking, from th
2 CONC e boundaries of Thuringia, on the east, to what is now the Belgian and No
2 CONC rman coastline, on the west; it bordered to the north on Saxony, and incl
2 CONC uded both banks of the Rhine from Cologne (the ancient Colonia Agrippina
2 CONC ) to the North Sea; its southern neighbours were the Bavarians, the Alema
2 CONC nni, and the Burgundians. The dependent states were: the fundamentally Ga
2 CONC ulish Neustria (including within its borders Paris), which was, neverthel
2 CONC ess, well leavened with a dominant Frankish element; to the southwest o
2 CONC f Neustria, Brittany, formerly Armorica, with a British and Gallo-Roman p
2 CONC opulation; to the south of Neustria the Duchy of Aquitaine, lying, for th
2 CONC e most part, between the Loire and the Garonne, with a decidedly Gallo-Ro
2 CONC man population; and east of Aquitaine, along the valley of the Rhone, th
2 CONC e Burgundians, a people of much the same mixed origin as those of Aquitai
2 CONC ne, though with a large infusion of Teutonic blood. These States, with pe
2 CONC rhaps the exception of Brittany, recognized the Theodosian Code as thei
2 CONC r law. The German dependencies of the Frankish kingdom were Thuringia, i
2 CONC n the valley of the Main, Bavaria, and Alemannia (corresponding to what w
2 CONC as later known as Swabia). These last, at the time of Pepin's death, ha
2 CONC d but recently been won to Christianity, mainly through the preaching o
2 CONC f St. Boniface. The share which fell to Charles consisted of all Austrasi
2 CONC a (the original Frankland), most of Neustria, and all of Aquitaine excep
2 CONC t the southeast corner. In this way the possessions of the elder brothe
2 CONC r surrounded the younger on two sides, but on the other hand the distribu
2 CONC tion of mm under their respective rules was such as to preclude any ris
2 CONC k of discord arising out of the national sentiments of their various subj
2 CONC ects. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In spite of this provident arrangement, Carloman contrived to quarrel wi
2 CONC th his brother. Hunald, formerly Duke of Aquitaine, vanquished by Pepin t
2 CONC he Short, broke from the cloister, where he had lived as a monk for twent
2 CONC y years, and stirred up a revolt in the western part of the duchy. By Fra
2 CONC nkish custom Carloman should have aided Charles; the younger brother hims
2 CONC elf held part of Aquitaine; but he pretended that, as his dominion were u
2 CONC naffected by this revolt, it was no business of his. Hunald, however, wa
2 CONC s vanquished by Charles single-handed; he was betrayed by a nephew with w
2 CONC hom he had sought refuge, was sent to Rome to answer for the violation o
2 CONC f his monastic vows, and at last, after once more breaking cloister, wa
2 CONC s stoned to death by the Lombards of Pavia. For Charles the true importan
2 CONC ce of this Aquitanian episode was in its manifestation his brother's unki
2 CONC ndly feeling in his regard, and against this danger he lost no time in ta
2 CONC king precautions, chiefly by winning over to himself the friends whom h
2 CONC e judged likely to be most valuable; first and foremost of these was hi
2 CONC s mother, Bertha, who had striven both earnestly and prudently to make pe
2 CONC ace between her sons, but who, when it became necessary to take sides wit
2 CONC h one or the other could not hesitate in her devotion to the elder. Charl
2 CONC es was an affectionate son; it also appears that, in general, he was help
2 CONC ed to power by his extraordinary gift of personal attractiveness. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Carloman died soon after this (4 December, 771), and a certain letter fr
2 CONC om "the Monk Cathwulph", quoted by Bouquet (Recueil. hist., V, 634), in e
2 CONC numerating the special blessings for which the king was in duty bound t
2 CONC o be grateful, says, 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Third . . . God has preserved you from the wiles of your brothe
2 CONC r . . . . Fifth, and not the least, that God has removed your brother fro
2 CONC m this earthly kingdom.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Carloman may not have been quite so malignant as the enthusiastic partis
2 CONC ans of Charles made him out, but the division of Pepin's dominions was i
2 CONC n itself an impediment to the growth of a strong Frankish realm such as C
2 CONC harles needed for the unification of the Christian Continent. Although Ca
2 CONC rloman had left two sons by his wife, Gerberga, the Frankish law of inher
2 CONC itance gave no preference to sons as against brother; left to their own c
2 CONC hoice, the Frankish lieges, whether from love of Charles or for the fea
2 CONC r which his name already inspired, gladly accepted him for their king. Ge
2 CONC rberga and her children fled to the Lombard court of Pavia. In the mean w
2 CONC hile complications had arisen in Charles' foreign policy which made his n
2 CONC ewly established supremacy at home doubly opportune. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT From his father Charles had inherited the title "Patricius Romanus" whic
2 CONC h carried with it a special obligation to protect the temporal rights o
2 CONC f the Holy See. The nearest and most menacing neighbour of St. Peter's Pa
2 CONC trimony was Desidarius (Didier), King of the Lombards, and it was with th
2 CONC is potentate that the dowager Bertha had arranged a matrimonial allianc
2 CONC e for her elder son. The pope had solid temporal reasons for objecting t
2 CONC o this arrangement. Moreover, Charles was already, in foro conscientiae
2 CONC , if not in Frankish law, wedded to Himiltrude. In defiance of the pope'
2 CONC s protest (PL 98:250), Charles married Desiderata, daughter of Desideriu
2 CONC s (770), three years later he repudiated her and married Hildegarde, th
2 CONC e beautiful Swabian. Naturally, Desiderius was furious at this insult, an
2 CONC d the dominions of the Holy See bore the first brunt of his wrath. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT But Charles had to defend his own borders against the heathen as well a
2 CONC s to protect Rome against the Lombard. To the north of Austrasia lay Fris
2 CONC ia, which seems to have been in some equivocal way a dependency, and to t
2 CONC he east of Frisia, from the left bank of the Ems (about the present Holla
2 CONC nd-Westphalia frontier), across the valley of the Weser and Aller, and st
2 CONC ill eastward to the left bank of the Elbe, extended the country of the Sa
2 CONC xons, who in no fashion whatever acknowledged any allegiance to the Frank
2 CONC ish kings. In 772 these Saxons were a horde of aggressive pagans offerin
2 CONC g to Christian missionaries no hope but that of martyrdom; bound together
2 CONC , normally, by no political organization, and constantly engaged in preda
2 CONC tory incursions into the lands of the Franks. Their language seems to hav
2 CONC e been very like that spoken by the Egberts and Ethelreds of Britain, bu
2 CONC t the work of their Christian cousin, St. Boniface, had not affected the
2 CONC m as yet; they worshipped the gods of Walhalla, united in solemn sacrific
2 CONC e -- sometimes human -- to Irminsul (Igdrasail), the sacred tree which st
2 CONC ood at Eresburg, and were still slaying Christian missionaries when thei
2 CONC r kinsmen in Britain were holding church synods and building cathedrals
2 CONC . Charles could brook neither their predatory habits nor their heathenis
2 CONC h intolerance; it was impossible, moreover, to make permanent peace wit
2 CONC h them while they followed the old Teutonic life of free village communit
2 CONC ies. He made his first expedition into their country in July, 772, took E
2 CONC resburg by storm, and burned Irminsul. It was in January of this same yea
2 CONC r that Pope Stephen III died, and Adrian I (q.v.), an opponent of Desider
2 CONC ius, was elected. The new pope was almost immediately assailed by the Lom
2 CONC bard king, who seized three minor cities of the Patrimony of St. Peter, t
2 CONC hreatened Ravenna itself, and set about organizing a plot within the Curi
2 CONC a. Paul Afiarta, the papal chamberlain, detected acting as the Lombard'
2 CONC s secret agent, was seized and put to death. The Lombard army advanced ag
2 CONC ainst Rome, but quailed before the spiritual weapons of the Church, whil
2 CONC e Adrian sent a legate into Gaul to claim the aid of of the Patrician. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Thus it was that Charles, resting at Thionville after his Saxon campaign
2 CONC , was urgently reminded of the rough work that awaited his hand south o
2 CONC f the Alps. Desiderius' embassy reached him soon after Adrian's. He did n
2 CONC ot take it for granted that the right was all upon Adrian's side; besides
2 CONC , he may have seen here an opportunity make some amends for his repudiati
2 CONC on of the Lombard princess. Before taking up arms for the Holy See, there
2 CONC fore, he sent commissioners into Italy to make enquiries and when Desider
2 CONC ius pretended that the seizure of the papal cities was in effect only th
2 CONC e legal foreclosure of a mortgage, Charles promptly offered to redeem the
2 CONC m by a money payment. But Desiderius refused the money, and as Charles' c
2 CONC ommissioners reported in favour of Adrian, the only course left was war. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In the spring of 773 Charles summoned the whole military strength of th
2 CONC e Franks for a great invasion of Lombardy. He was slow to strike, but h
2 CONC e meant to strike hard. Data for any approximate estimate of his numerica
2 CONC l strength are lacking, but it is certain that the army, in order to mak
2 CONC e the descent more swiftly, crossed the Alps by two passes: Mont Cenis an
2 CONC d the Great St. Bernard. Einhard, who accompanied the king over Mont Ceni
2 CONC s (the St. Bernard column was led by Duke Bernhard), speaks feelingly o
2 CONC f the marvels and perils of the passage. The invaders found Desiderius wa
2 CONC iting for them, entrenched at Susa; they turned his flank and put the Lom
2 CONC bard army to utter rout. Leaving all the cities of the plains to their fa
2 CONC te, Desiderius rallied part of his forces in Pavia, his walled capital, w
2 CONC hile his son Adalghis, with the rest, occupied Verona. Charles, having be
2 CONC en joined by Duke Bernhard, took the forsaken cities on his way and the
2 CONC n completely invested Pavia (September, 773), whence Otger, the faithfu
2 CONC l attendant of Gerberga, could look with trembling upon the array of hi
2 CONC s countrymen. Soon after Christmas Charles withdrew from the siege a port
2 CONC ion of the army which he employed in the capture of Verona. Here he foun
2 CONC d Gerberga and her children; as to what became of them, history is silent
2 CONC ; they probably entered the cloister. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT What history does record with vivid eloquence is the first visit of Char
2 CONC les to the Eternal City. There everything was done to give his entry as m
2 CONC uch as possible the air of a triumph in ancient Rome. The judges met hi
2 CONC m thirty miles from the city; the militia laid at the feet of their grea
2 CONC t patrician the banner of Rome and hailed him as their imperator. Charle
2 CONC s himself forgot pagan Rome and prostrated himself to kiss the threshol
2 CONC d of the Apostles, and then spent seven days in conference with the succe
2 CONC ssor of Peter. It was then that he undoubtedly formed many great design
2 CONC s for the glory of God and the exaltation of Holy Church, which, in spit
2 CONC e of human weaknesses and, still more, ignorance, he afterwards did his b
2 CONC est to realize. His coronation as the successor of Constantine did not ta
2 CONC ke place until twenty-six years later, but his consecration as first cham
2 CONC pion of the Catholic Church took place at Easter, 774. Soon after this (J
2 CONC une, 774) Pavia fell, Desiderius was banished, Adalghis became a fugitiv
2 CONC e at the Byzantine court, and Charles, assuming the crown of Lombardy, re
2 CONC newed to Adrian the donation of of territory made by Pepin the Short afte
2 CONC r his defeat of Aistulph. (This donation is now generally admitted, as we
2 CONC ll as the original gift of Pepin at Kiersy in 752. The so-called "Privile
2 CONC gium Hadriani pro Carolo" granting him full right to nominate the pope an
2 CONC d to invest all bishops is a forgery.) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT To the Baptism of Wittekind (774-785) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The next twenty years of Charles' life may be considered as one long war
2 CONC fare. They are filled with an astounding series of rapid marches from en
2 CONC d to end of a continent intersected by mountains, morasses, and forests
2 CONC , and scantily provided with roads. It would seem that the key to his lon
2 CONC g series of victories, won almost as much by moral ascendancy as by physi
2 CONC cal or mental superiority, is to be found in the inspiration communicate
2 CONC d to his Frankish champion by Pope Adrian I. Weiss (Weltgesch., 11, 549
2 CONC ) enumerates fifty-three distinct campaigns of Charlemagne; of these it i
2 CONC s possible to point to only twelve or fourteen which were not undertake
2 CONC n principally or entirely in execution of his mission as the soldier an
2 CONC d protector of the Church. In his eighteen campaigns against the Saxons C
2 CONC harles was more or less actuated by the desire to extinguish what he an
2 CONC d his people regarded as a form of devil-worship, no less odious to the
2 CONC m than the fetishism of Central Africa is to us. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT While he was still in Italy the Saxons, irritated but not subdued by th
2 CONC e fate of Eresburg and of Irminsul had risen in arms, harried the countr
2 CONC y of the Hessian Franks, and burned many churches; that of St. Boniface a
2 CONC t Fritzlar, being of stone, had defeated their efforts. Returning to th
2 CONC e north, Charles sent a preliminary column of cavalry into the enemy's co
2 CONC untry while he held a council of the realm at Kiersy (Quercy) in Septembe
2 CONC r, 774, at which it was decided that the Saxons (Westfali, Ostfali, and A
2 CONC ngrarii) must be presented with the alternative of baptism or death. Th
2 CONC e northeastern campaigns of the next seven years had for their object a c
2 CONC onquest so decisive as to make the execution of this policy feasible. Th
2 CONC e year 775 saw the first of a series of Frankish military colonies, on th
2 CONC e ancient Roman plan established at Sigeburg among the Westfali. Charle
2 CONC s next subdued, temporarily at least, the Ostali, whose chieftain, Hessi
2 CONC , having accepted baptism, ended his life in the monastery of Fulda (se
2 CONC e BONIFACE, SAINT; FULDA). Then, a Frankish camp at Lbbecke on the Wese
2 CONC r having been surprised by the Saxons, and its garrison slaughtered, Char
2 CONC les turned again westward, once more routed the Westfali, and received th
2 CONC eir oaths of submission. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT At this stage (776) the affairs of Lombardy interrupted the Saxon crusad
2 CONC e. Areghis of Beneventum, son-in-law of the vanquished Desiderius, had fo
2 CONC rmed a plan with his brother-in-law Adalghis (Adelchis), then an exile a
2 CONC t Constantinople, by which the latter was to make a descent upon Italy, b
2 CONC acked by the Eastern emperor; Adrian was at the same time involved in a q
2 CONC uarrel with the three Lombard dukes, Reginald of Clusium, Rotgaud of Friu
2 CONC li, and Hildebrand of Spoleto. The archbishop of Ravenna, who called hims
2 CONC elf "primate" and "exarch of Italy", was also attempting to found an inde
2 CONC pendent principality at the expense of the papal state but was finally su
2 CONC bdued in 776, and his successor compelled to be content with the title o
2 CONC f "Vicar" or representative of the pope. The junction of the aforesaid po
2 CONC wers, all inimical to the pope and the Franks, while Charles was occupie
2 CONC d in Westphalia, was only prevented by the death of Constantine Copronymu
2 CONC s in September, 775 (see BYZANTINE EMPIRE). After winning over Hildebran
2 CONC d and Reginald by diplomacy, Charles descended into Lombardy by the Brenn
2 CONC er Pass (spring of 776), defeated Rotgaud, and leaving garrisons and gove
2 CONC rnors, or counts (comites), as they were termed, in the reconquered citie
2 CONC s of the Duchy of Friuli, hastened back to Saxony. There the Frankish gar
2 CONC rison had been forced to evacuate Eresburg, while the siege of Sigeburg w
2 CONC as so unexpectedly broken up as to give occasion later to a legend of ang
2 CONC elic intervention in favour of the Christians. As usual, the almost incre
2 CONC dible suddenness of the king's reappearance and the moral effect of his p
2 CONC resence quieted the ragings of the heathen. Charles then divided the Saxo
2 CONC n territory into Missionary districts. At the great spring hosting (cham
2 CONC p de Mai) of Paderborn, in 777, many Saxon converts were baptized; Wittek
2 CONC ind (Widukind), however, already the leader and afterwards the popular he
2 CONC ro of the Saxons, had fled to his brother-in-law, Sigfrid the Dane. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The episode of the invasion of Spain comes next in chronological order
2 CONC . The condition of the venerable Iberian Church, still suffering under Mo
2 CONC slem domination, appealed strongly to the king's sympathy. In 777 there c
2 CONC ame to Paderborn three Moorish emirs, enemies of the Ommeyad Abderrahman
2 CONC , the Moorish King of Cordova. These emirs did homage to Charles and prop
2 CONC osed to him an invasion of Northern Spain; one of the, Ibn-el-Arabi, prom
2 CONC ised to bring to the invaders' assistance a force of Berber auxiliaries f
2 CONC rom Africa; the other two promised to exert their powerful influence at B
2 CONC arcelona and elsewhere north of the Ebro. Accordingly, in the spring of 7
2 CONC 78, Charles, with a host of crusaders, speaking many tongues, and which n
2 CONC umbered among its constituents even a quota of Lombards, moved towards th
2 CONC e Pyrenees. His trusted lieutenant, Duke Bernhard. with one division, ent
2 CONC ered Spain by the coast. Charles himself marched through the mountain pas
2 CONC ses straight to Pampelona. But Ibn-el-Arabi, who had prematurely brough
2 CONC t on his army of Berbers, was assassinated by the emissary of Abderrahman
2 CONC , and though Pampelona was razed, and Barcelona and other cities fell, Sa
2 CONC ragossa held out. Apart from the moral effect of this campaign upon the M
2 CONC oslem rulers of Spain, its result was insignificant, though the famous am
2 CONC buscade in which perished Roland, the great Paladin, at the Pass of Ronce
2 CONC svalles, furnished to the medieval world the material for its most glorio
2 CONC us and influential epic, the "Chanson de Roland". 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Much more important to posterity were the next succeeding events which c
2 CONC ontinued and decided the long struggle in Saxony. During the Spanish crus
2 CONC ade Wittekind had returned from his exile, bringing with him Danish allie
2 CONC s, and was now ravaging Hesse; the Rhine valley from Deutz to Andenach wa
2 CONC s a prey to the Saxon "devil-worshipers"; the Christian missionaries wer
2 CONC e scattered or in hiding. Charles gathered his hosts at Dren, in June, 7
2 CONC 79, and stormed Wittekind's entrenched camp at Bocholt, after which campa
2 CONC ign he seems to have considered Saxony a fairly subdued country. At any r
2 CONC ate, the "Saxon Capitulary" (see CAPITULARIES) of 781 obliged all Saxon
2 CONC s not only to accept baptism (and this on the pain of death) but also t
2 CONC o pay tithes, as the Franks did for the support of the Church; moreover i
2 CONC t confiscated a large amount of property for the benefit of the missions
2 CONC . This was Wittekind's last opportunity to restore the national independe
2 CONC nce and paganism; his people, exasperated against the Franks and their Go
2 CONC d, eagerly rushed to arms. At Suntal on the Weser, Charles being absent
2 CONC , they defeated a Frankish army killing two royal legates and five Counts
2 CONC . But Wittekind committed the error of enlisting as allies the non-Teuton
2 CONC ic Sorbs from beyond the Saale; race-antagonism soon weakened his forces
2 CONC , and the Saxon hosts melted away. Of the so-called "Massacre of Verdun
2 CONC " (783) it is fair to say that the 4500 Saxons who perished were not pris
2 CONC oners of war; legally, they were ringleaders in a rebellion, selected a
2 CONC s such from a number of their fellow rebels. Wittekind himself escaped be
2 CONC yond the Elbe. It was not until after another defeat of the Saxons at Det
2 CONC mold, and again at Osnabrck, on the "Hill of Slaughter", that Wittekin
2 CONC d acknowledged the God of Charles the stronger than Odin. In 785 Wittekin
2 CONC d received baptism at Attigny, and Charles stood godfather. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Last Steps to the Imperial Throne (785-800) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The summer of 783 began a new period in the life of Charles, in which si
2 CONC gns begin to appear of his less amiable traits. It was in this year, sign
2 CONC alized, according to the chroniclers, by unexampled heat and a pestilence
2 CONC , that the two queens died, Bertha, the king's mother, and Hildegarde, hi
2 CONC s second (or his third) wife. Both of these women, the former in particul
2 CONC ar, had exercised over him a strong influence for good. Within a few mont
2 CONC hs the king married Fastrada, daughter of an Austrasian count. The succee
2 CONC ding years were, comparatively speaking, years of harvest after the stupe
2 CONC ndous period of ploughing and sowing that had gone before; and Charles' n
2 CONC ature was of a type that appears to best advantage in storm and stress. W
2 CONC hat was to be the Western Empire of the Middle Ages was already hewn ou
2 CONC t in the rough when Wittekind received baptism. From that date until th
2 CONC e coronation of Charles at Rome, in 800, his military work was chiefly i
2 CONC n suppressing risings of the newly conquered or quelling the discontent
2 CONC s of jealous subject princes. Thrice in these fifteen years did the Saxon
2 CONC s rise, only to be defeated. Tassilo, Duke of Bavaria, had been a more o
2 CONC r less rebellious vassal ever since the beginning of his reign, and Charl
2 CONC es now made use of the pope's influence, exercised through the powerful b
2 CONC ishops of Freising, Salzburg, and Regensburg (Ratisbon), to bring him t
2 CONC o terms. In 786 a Thuringian revolt was quelled by the timely death, blin
2 CONC ding, and banishment of its leaders. Next year the Lombard prince, Areghi
2 CONC s, having fortified himself at Salerno, had actually been crowned King o
2 CONC f the Lombards when Charles descended upon him at Beneventum, received hi
2 CONC s submission, and took his son Grimwald as a hostage, after which, findin
2 CONC g that Tassilo had been secretly associated with the conspiracy of the Lo
2 CONC mbards, he invaded Bavaria from three sides with three armies drawn fro
2 CONC m at least five nationalities. Once more the influence of the Holy See se
2 CONC ttled the Bavarian question in Charles' favour; Adrian threatened Tassil
2 CONC o with excommunication if he persisted in rebellion, and as the Duke's ow
2 CONC n subjects refused to follow him to the field, he personally made submiss
2 CONC ion, did homage, and in return received from Charles a new lease of his d
2 CONC uchy (October, 787). 
2 CONT 
2 CONT During this period the national discontent with Fastrada culminated i
2 CONC n a plot in which Pepin the Hunchback, Charles' son by Himiltrude, was im
2 CONC plicated, and though his life was spared through his father's intercessio
2 CONC n, Pepin spent what remained of his days in a monastery. Another son of C
2 CONC harles (Carloman, afterwards called Pepin, and crowned King of Lombardy a
2 CONC t Rome in 781, on the occasion of an Easter visit by the king, at which t
2 CONC ime also his brother Louis was crowned King of Aquitaine) served his fath
2 CONC er in dealing with the Avars, a pagan danger on the frontier, compared wi
2 CONC th which the invasion of Septimania by the Saracens (793) was but an insi
2 CONC gnificant incident of border warfare. These Avars, probably of Turanian b
2 CONC lood, occupied the territories north of the Save and west of the Theiss
2 CONC . Tassilo had invited their assistance against his overlord; and after th
2 CONC e Duke's final submission Charles invaded their country and conquered i
2 CONC t as far as the Raab (791). By the capture of the famous "Ring" of the Av
2 CONC ars, with its nine concentric circles, Charles came into possession of va
2 CONC st quantities of gold and silver, parts of the plunder which these barbar
2 CONC ians had been accumulating for two centuries. In this campaign King Pepi
2 CONC n of Lombardy cooperated with his father, with forces drawn from Italy; t
2 CONC he later stages of this war (which may be considered the last of Charles
2 CONC ' great wars) were left in the hands of the younger king. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The last stages by which the story of Charles' career is brought to it
2 CONC s climax touch upon the exclusive spiritual domain of the Church. He ha
2 CONC d never ceased to interest himself in the deliberations of synods, and th
2 CONC is interest extended (an example that wrought fatal results in after ages
2 CONC ) to the discussion of questions which would now be regarded as purely do
2 CONC gmatic. Charles interfered in the dispute about the Adoptionist heresy (s
2 CONC ee ADOPTIONISM; ALCUIN; FRANKFORT, COUNCIL OF). His interference was les
2 CONC s pleasing to Adrian in the matter of Iconoclasm, a heresy with which th
2 CONC e Empress-mother Irene and Tarasius, Patriarch of Constantinople, had dea
2 CONC lt in the second Council of Nicaea. The Synod of Frankfort, wrongly infor
2 CONC med, but inspired by Charles, took upon itself to condemn the aforesaid C
2 CONC ouncil, although the latter had the sanction of the Holy See (see CAROLIN
2 CONC E BOOKS). In the year 797 the Eastern Emperor Constantine VI, with whom h
2 CONC is mother Irene had for some time been at variance, was by her dethroned
2 CONC , imprisoned, and blinded. It is significant of Charles' position as de f
2 CONC acto Emperor of the West that Irene sent envoys to Aachen to lay before C
2 CONC harles her side of this horrible story. It is also to be noted that the p
2 CONC opular impression that Constantine had been put to death, and the aversio
2 CONC n to committing the imperial sceptre to a woman's hand, also bore upon wh
2 CONC at followed. Lastly, it was to Charles alone that the Christians of the E
2 CONC ast were now crying out for succour against the threatening advance of th
2 CONC e Moslem Caliph Haroun al Raschid. In 795 Adrian I died (25 Dec.), deepl
2 CONC y regretted by Charles, who held this pope in great esteem and caused a L
2 CONC atin metrical epitaph to be prepared for the papal tomb. In 787 Charles h
2 CONC ad visited Rome for the third time in the interest of the pope and his se
2 CONC cure possession of the Patrimony of Peter. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Leo III, the immediate successor of Adrian I, notified Charles of his el
2 CONC ection (26 December, 795) to the Holy See. The king sent in return rich p
2 CONC resents by Abbot Angilbert, whom he commissioned to deal with the pope i
2 CONC n all manners pertaining to the royal office of Roman Patrician. While th
2 CONC is letter is respectful and even affectionate, it also exhibits Charles
2 CONC ' concept of the coordination of the spiritual and temporal powers, nor d
2 CONC oes he hesitate to remind the Pope of his grave spiritual obligations. Th
2 CONC e new pope, a Roman, had bitter enemies in the Eternal City, who spread t
2 CONC he most damaging reports of his previous life. At length (25 April, 799
2 CONC ) he was waylaid, and left unconscious. After escaping to St. Peter's h
2 CONC e was rescued by two of the king's missi, who came with a considerable fo
2 CONC rce. The Duke of Spoleto sheltered the fugitive pope, who went later to P
2 CONC aderborn, where the king's camp then was. Charles received the Vicar of C
2 CONC hrist with all due reverence. Leo was sent back to Rome escorted by roya
2 CONC l missi; the insurgents, thoroughly frightened and unable to convince Cha
2 CONC rles of the pope's iniquity, surrendered, and the missi sent Paschalis an
2 CONC d Campulus, nephews of Adrian I and ringleaders against Pope Leo, to th
2 CONC e king, to be dealt with at the royal pleasure. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Charles was in no hurry to take final action in this matter. He settle
2 CONC d various affairs connected with the frontier beyond the Elbe, with the p
2 CONC rotection of the Balearic Isles against the Saracens, and of Northern Gau
2 CONC l against Scandinavian sea-rovers, spent most of the winter at Aachen, an
2 CONC d was at St. Riquier for Easter. About this time, too, he was occupied a
2 CONC t the deathbed of Liutgarde, the queen whom he had married on the death o
2 CONC f Fastrada (794). At Tours he conferred with Alcuin, then summoned the ho
2 CONC st of the Franks to meet at Mainz and announced to them his intention o
2 CONC f again proceeding to Rome. Entering Italy by the Brenner Pass, he travel
2 CONC led by way of Ancona and Perugia to Nomentum, where Pope Leo met him an
2 CONC d the two entered Rome together. A synod was held and the charges agains
2 CONC t Leo pronounced false. On this occasion the Frankish bishops declared th
2 CONC emselves unauthorized to pass judgment on the Apostolic See. Of his own f
2 CONC ree will Leo, under oath, declared publicly in St. Peter's that he was in
2 CONC nocent of the charges brought against him. Leo requested that his accuser
2 CONC s, now themselves condemned to death, should be punished only with banish
2 CONC ment. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT After His Coronation in Rome(800-814) 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Two days later (Christmas Day, 800) took place the principal event in th
2 CONC e life of Charles. During the pontifical Mass celebrated by the pope, a
2 CONC s the king knelt in prayer before the high altar beneath which lay the bo
2 CONC dies of Sts. Peter and Paul, the Pope approached him, placed upon his hea
2 CONC d the imperial crown, did him formal reverence after the ancient manner
2 CONC , saluted him as Emperor and Augustus and anointed him, while the Roman
2 CONC s present burst out with the acclamation, thrice repeated: "To Carolus Au
2 CONC gustus crowned by God, mighty and pacific emperor, be life and victory" (
2 CONC Carolo, piisimo Augusto a Deo coronato, magno et pacificio Imperatori, vi
2 CONC ta et vicotria). These details are gathered from contemporary accounts (L
2 CONC ife of Leo III in "lib. Pont."; "Annales Laurissense majores"; Einhard'
2 CONC s Vita Caroli; Theophanes). Though not all are found in any one narrative
2 CONC , there is no good reason for doubting their general accuracy. Einhard'
2 CONC s statement (Vita Caroli 28) that Charles had no suspicion of what was ab
2 CONC out to happen, and if pre-informed would not have accepted the imperial c
2 CONC rown, is much discussed, some seeing in it an unwillingness to imperial a
2 CONC uthority on an ecclesiastical basis, others more justly a natural hesitat
2 CONC ion before a momentous step overcome by the positive action of friends an
2 CONC d admirers, and culminating; in the scene just described. On the other ha
2 CONC nd, there seems no reason to doubt that for some time previous the elevat
2 CONC ion of Charles had been discussed, both at home and at Rome, especially i
2 CONC n view of two facts: the scandalous condition of the imperial governmen
2 CONC t at Constantinople, and the acknowledged grandeur and solidity of the Ca
2 CONC rolingian house. He owed his elevation not to the conquest of Rome, nor t
2 CONC o any act of the Roman Senate (then a mere municipal body), much less t
2 CONC o the local citizenship of Rome, but to the pope, who exercised in a supr
2 CONC eme juncture the moral supremacy in Western Christendom which the age wid
2 CONC ely recognized in him, and to which, indeed, Charles even then owed the t
2 CONC itle that the popes had transferred to his father Pepin. It is certain th
2 CONC at Charles constantly attributed his imperial dignity to an act of God, m
2 CONC ade known of course through the agency of the Vicar of Christ (divino nut
2 CONC u coronatus, a Deo coronatus, in "Capitularia", ed. Baluze, I, 247, 341
2 CONC , 345); also that after the ceremony he made very rich gifts to the Basil
2 CONC ica of St. Peter, and that on the same day the pope anointed (as King o
2 CONC f the Franks) the younger Charles, son of the emperor and at that time pr
2 CONC obably destined to succeed in the imperial dignity. The Roman Empire (Imp
2 CONC erium Romanum), since 476 practically extinguished in the West, save fo
2 CONC r a brief interval in the sixth century, was restored by this papal act
2 CONC , which became the historical basis of the future relations between the p
2 CONC opes and the successors of Charlemagne (throughout the Middle Ages no Wes
2 CONC tern Emperor was considered legitimate unless he had been crowned and ano
2 CONC inted at Rome by the successor of St. Peter). Despite the earlier goodwil
2 CONC l and help of the papacy, the Emperor of Constantinople, legitimate hei
2 CONC r of the imperial title (he still called himself Roman Emperor, and his c
2 CONC apital was officially New Rome) had long proved incapable of preserving h
2 CONC is authority in the Italian peninsula. Palace revolutions and heresy, no
2 CONC t to speak of fiscal oppression, racial antipathy, and impotent but vicio
2 CONC us intrigues, made him odious to the Romans and Italians generally. In an
2 CONC y case, since the Donation of Pepin (752) the pope was formally sovereig
2 CONC n of the duchy of Rome and the Exarchate; hence, apart from its effect o
2 CONC n his shadowy claim to the sovereignty of all Italy, the Byzantine rule
2 CONC r had nothing to lose by the elevation of Charles. However, the event o
2 CONC f Christmas Day, 800, was long resented at Constantinople, where eventual
2 CONC ly the successor of Charles was occasionally called "Emperor", or "Empero
2 CONC r of the Franks", but never "Roman Emperor". (For a more specific accoun
2 CONC t of the new Western Empire; its nature, scope, and other important point
2 CONC s, see HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE; TEMPORAL POWER.) Suffice it to add here that wh
2 CONC ile the imperial consecration made him in theory, what he was already i
2 CONC n fact, the principal ruler of the West, and impropriated, as it were, i
2 CONC n the Carolingian line the majesty of ancient Rome, it also lifted Charle
2 CONC s at once to the dignity of supreme temporal protector of Western Christe
2 CONC ndom and in particular of its head, the Roman Church. Nor did this mean o
2 CONC nly the local welfare of the papacy, the good order and peace of the Patr
2 CONC imony of Peter. It meant also, in face of the yet vast pagan world (barba
2 CONC rae nationes) of the North and the Southeast, a religious responsibility
2 CONC , encouragement and protection of missions, advancement of Christian cult
2 CONC ure, organization of dioceses, enforcement of a Christian discipline of l
2 CONC ife, improvement of the clergy, in a word, all the forms of governmenta
2 CONC l cooperation with the Church that we meet with in the life and the legis
2 CONC lation of Charles. Long before this event Pope Adrian I had conferred (77
2 CONC 4) on Charles his father's dignity of Patricius Romanus, which implied pr
2 CONC imarily the protection of the Roman Church in all its rights and privileg
2 CONC es, above all in the temporal authority which it had gradually acquired (
2 CONC notably in the former Byzantine Duchy of Rome and the Exarchate of Ravenn
2 CONC a) by just titles in the course of the two preceding centuries. (See TEMP
2 CONC ORAL POWER.) Charles, it is true, after his imperial consecration exercis
2 CONC ed practically at Rome his authority as Patricius, or protector of the Ro
2 CONC man Church. But he did this with all due recognition of the papal soverei
2 CONC gnty and principally to prevent the quasi-anarchy which local intrigues a
2 CONC nd passions, family interests and ambitions, and adverse Byzantine agenci
2 CONC es were promoting. It would be unhistorical to maintain that as emperor h
2 CONC e ignored at once the civil sovereignty of the pope in the Patrimony of P
2 CONC eter. This (the Duchy of Rome and the Exarchate) he significantly omitte
2 CONC d from the partition of the Frankish State made at the Diet of Thionville
2 CONC , in 806. It is to be noted that in this public division of his estate h
2 CONC e made no provision for the imperial title, also that he committed to al
2 CONC l three sons "the defence and protection of the Roman Church". In 817 Lou
2 CONC is the Pious, by a famous charter whose substantial authenticity there i
2 CONC s no good reason to doubt, confirmed to Pope Paschal and his successors f
2 CONC orever, "the city of Rome with its duchy and dependencies, as the same ha
2 CONC ve been held to this day by your predecessors, under their authority an
2 CONC d jurisdiction", adding that he did not pretend to any jurisdiction in sa
2 CONC id territory, except when solicited thereto by the pope. It may be note
2 CONC d here that the chroniclers of the ninth century treat as "restitution" t
2 CONC o St. Peter the various cessions and grants of cities and territory mad
2 CONC e at this period by the Carolingian rulers within the limits of the Patri
2 CONC mony of Peter. The Charter of Louis the Pious was afterwards confirmed b
2 CONC y Emperor Otto I in 962 and Henry II in 1020. These imperial documents ma
2 CONC ke it clear that the acts of authority exercised by the new emperor in th
2 CONC e Patrimony of Peter were only such as were called for by his office of D
2 CONC efender of the Roman Church. Kleinclausz (l'Empire carolingien, etc., Par
2 CONC is, 1902, 441 sqq.) denies the authenticity of the famous letter (871) o
2 CONC f Emperor Louis II to the Greek Emperor Basil (in which the former recogn
2 CONC izes fully the papal origin of his own imperial dignity), and attribute
2 CONC s it to Anastasius Bibliotheca in 879. His arguments are weak; the authen
2 CONC ticity is admitted by Gregorovius and O. Harnack. Anti-papal writers hav
2 CONC e undertaken to prove that Charles' dignity of Patricius Romanorum was eq
2 CONC uivalent to immediate and sole sovereign authority at Rome, and in law an
2 CONC d in fact excluded any papal sovereignty. In reality this Roman patriciat
2 CONC e, both under Pepin and Charles, was no more than a high protectorship o
2 CONC f the civil sovereignty of the pope, whose local independence, both befor
2 CONC e and after the coronation of Charles, is historically certain, even apar
2 CONC t from the aforesaid imperial charters. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The personal devotion of Charles to the Apostolic See is well known. Whi
2 CONC le in the preface to his Capitularies he calls himself the "devoted defen
2 CONC der and humble helper of Holy Church", he was especially fond of the basi
2 CONC lica of St. Peter at Rome. Einhard relates (Vita, c. xxvii) that he enric
2 CONC hed it beyond all other churches and that he was particularly anxious tha
2 CONC t the City of Rome should in his reign obtain again its ancient authority
2 CONC . He promulgated a special law on the respect due this See of Peter (Capi
2 CONC tulare de honoranda sede Apostolica, ed. Baluze I, 255). The letters of t
2 CONC he popes to himself, his father, and grandfather, were collected by his o
2 CONC rder in the famous "Codex Carolinus". Gregory VII tells us (Regest., VII
2 CONC , 23) that he placed a part of the conquered Saxon territory under the pr
2 CONC otection of St. Peter, and sent to Rome a tribute from the same. He recei
2 CONC ved from Pope Adrian the Roman canon law in the shape of the "Collectio D
2 CONC ionysia-Hadriana", and also (784-91) the "Gregorian Sacramentary" or litu
2 CONC rgical use of Rome, for the guidance of the Frankish Church. He furthere
2 CONC d also in the Frankish churches the introduction of the Gregorian chant
2 CONC . It is of interest to note that just before his coronation at Rome Charl
2 CONC es received three messengers from the Patriarch of Jerusalem, bearing t
2 CONC o the King of the Franks the keys of the Holy Sepulchre and the banner o
2 CONC f Jerusalem, "a recognition that the holiest place in Christendom was und
2 CONC er the protection of the great monarch of the West" (Hodgkin). Shortly af
2 CONC ter this event, the Caliph Haroun al Raschid sent an embassy to Charles
2 CONC , who continued to take a deep interest in the Holy Sepulchre, and buil
2 CONC t Latin monasteries at Jerusalem, also a hospital for pilgrims. To the sa
2 CONC me period belongs the foundation of the Schola Francorum near St. Peter'
2 CONC s Basilica, a refuge and hospital (with cemetery attached) for Frankish p
2 CONC ilgrims to Rome, now represented by the Campo Santo de' Tedeschi (q.v.) n
2 CONC ear the Vatican. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The main work of Charlemagne in the development of Western Christendom m
2 CONC ight have been considered accomplished had he now passed away. Of all tha
2 CONC t he added during the remaining thirteen years of his life nothing increa
2 CONC sed perceptibly the stability of the structure. His military power and hi
2 CONC s instinct for organization had been successfully applied to the formatio
2 CONC n of a material power pledged to the support of the papacy, and on the ot
2 CONC her hand at least one pope (Adrian) had lent all the spiritual strength o
2 CONC f the Holy See to help build up the new Western Empire, which his immedia
2 CONC te successor (Leo) was to solemnly consecrate. Indeed, the remaining thir
2 CONC teen years of Charles' earthly career seem to illustrate rather the drawb
2 CONC acks of an intimate connection between Church and State than its advantag
2 CONC es. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In those years nothing like the military activity of the emperor's earli
2 CONC er life appears; there were much fewer enemies to conquer. Charles' son
2 CONC s led here and there an expedition, as when Louis captured Barcelona (801
2 CONC ) or the younger Charles invaded the territory of the Sorbs. But their fa
2 CONC ther had somewhat larger business on his hands at this time; above all, h
2 CONC e had to either conciliate or neutralize the jealousy of the Byzantine Em
2 CONC pire which still had the prestige of old tradition. At Rome Charles had b
2 CONC een hailed in due form as "Augustus" by the Roman people, but he could no
2 CONC t help realizing that many centuries before, the right of conferring thi
2 CONC s title had virtually passed from Old to New Rome. New Rome, i.e. Constan
2 CONC tinople, affected to regard Leo's act as one of schism. Nicephorus, the s
2 CONC uccessor of Irene (803) entered into diplomatic relations with Charles, i
2 CONC t is true, but would not recognize his imperial character. According to o
2 CONC ne account (Theophanes) Charles had sought Irene in marriage, but his pla
2 CONC n was defeated. The Frankish emperor then took up the cause of rebelliou
2 CONC s Venetia and Dalmatia. The war was carried on by sea, under King Pepin
2 CONC , and in 812, after the death of Nicephorus, a Byzantine embassy at Aache
2 CONC n actually addressed Charles as Basileus. About this time Charles again t
2 CONC renched upon the teaching prerogative of the Church, in the matter of th
2 CONC e Filioque although in this instance also the Holy See admitted the sound
2 CONC ness of his doctrine, while condemning his usurpation of its functions. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT The other source of discord which appeared in the new Western Empire, an
2 CONC d from its very beginning, was that of the succession. Charles made no pr
2 CONC etence either of right of primogeniture for his eldest son or to name a s
2 CONC uccessor for himself. As Pepin the Short had divided the Frankish realm
2 CONC , so did Charles divide the empire among his sons, naming none of them em
2 CONC peror. By the will which he made in 806 the greater part of what was late
2 CONC r called France went to Louis the Pious; Frankland proper, Frisia, Saxony
2 CONC , Hesse, and Franconia were to be the heritage of Charles the Young; Pepi
2 CONC n received Lombardy and its Italian dependencies, Bavaria, and Southern A
2 CONC lemannia. But Pepin and Charles pre-deceased the emperor, and in 813 th
2 CONC e magnates of the empire did homage at Aachen to Louis the Pious as Kin
2 CONC g of the Franks, and future sole ruler of the great imperial state. Thu
2 CONC s is was that the Carolingian Empire, as a dynastic institution, ended wi
2 CONC th the death of Charles the Fat (888), while the Holy Roman Empire, conti
2 CONC nued by Otto the Great (968-973), lacked all that is now France. But th
2 CONC e idea of a Europe welded together out of various races under the spiritu
2 CONC al influence of one Catholic Faith and one Vicar of Christ had been exhib
2 CONC ited in the concrete. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT It remains to say something of the achievements of Charlemagne at home
2 CONC . His life was so full of movement, so made up of long journeys, that hom
2 CONC e in his case signifies little more than the personal environment of hi
2 CONC s court, wherever it might happen to be on any given day. There was, it i
2 CONC s true, a general preference for Austrasia, or Frankland (after Aachen, W
2 CONC orms, Nymwegen, and Ingleheim were favourite residences). He took a dee
2 CONC p and intelligent interest in the agricultural development of the realm
2 CONC , and in the growth of trade, both domestic and foreign. The civil legisl
2 CONC ative work of Charles consisted principally in organizing and codifying t
2 CONC he principles of Frankish law handed down from antiquity; thus in 802 th
2 CONC e laws of the Frisians, Thuringians, and Saxons were reduced to writing
2 CONC . Among these principles, it is important to note, was one by which no fr
2 CONC ee man could be deprived of life or liberty without the judgment of his e
2 CONC quals in the state. The spirit of his legislation was above all religious
2 CONC ; he recognized as a basis and norm the ecclesiastical canons, was wont t
2 CONC o submit his projects of law to the bishops, or to give civil authority t
2 CONC o the decrees of synods. More than once he made laws at the suggestion o
2 CONC f popes or bishops. For administrative purposes the State was divided int
2 CONC o counties and hundreds, for the government of which counts and hundred-m
2 CONC en were responsible. Side by side with the counts in the great national p
2 CONC arliament (Reichstag, Diet) which normally met in the spring, sat the bis
2 CONC hops, and the spiritual constituency was so closely intertwined with th
2 CONC e temporal that in reading of a "council" under Charles, it is not alway
2 CONC s easy to ascertain whether the particular proceedings are supposed to b
2 CONC e those of a parliament or of a synod. Nevertheless this parliament or di
2 CONC et was essentially bicameral (civil and ecclesiastical), and the foregoin
2 CONC g descriptions applies to the mutual discussion of res mixtae or subject
2 CONC s pertaining to both orders. The one Frankish administrative institutio
2 CONC n to which Charles gave an entirely new character was the missi dominici
2 CONC , representatives (civil and ecclesiastical) of the royal authority, wh
2 CONC o from being royal messengers assumed under him functions much like thos
2 CONC e of papal legates, i.e. they were partly royal commissioners, partly iti
2 CONC nerant governors. There were usually two for each province (an ecclesiast
2 CONC ic and a lay lord), and they were bound to visit their territory (missati
2 CONC ca) four times each year. Between these missi and the local governors o
2 CONC r counts the power of the former great crown-vassals (dukes, Herzge) wa
2 CONC s parcelled out. Local justice was administered by the aforesaid count (c
2 CONC omes, Graf) in his court, held three times each year (placitum generale)
2 CONC , with the aid of seven assessors (scabini, rachimburgi), but there wa
2 CONC s a graduated appeal ending in the person of the emperor. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT While enough has been said above to show how ready he was to interfere i
2 CONC n the Church's domain, it does not appear that this propensity arose fro
2 CONC m motives discreditable to his religious character. It would be absurd t
2 CONC o pretend that Charlemagne was a consistent lifelong hypocrite; if he wa
2 CONC s not, then his keen practical interest in all that pertained to the serv
2 CONC ices of the Church, his participation even in the chanting of the choir (
2 CONC though, as his biographer says, "in a subdued voice") his fastidious atte
2 CONC ntion to questions of rites and ceremonies (Monachus Sangallensis), go t
2 CONC o show, like many other traits related of him, that his strong rough natu
2 CONC re was really impregnated with zeal, however mistaken at times, for the e
2 CONC arthly glory of God. He sought to elevate and perfect the clergy, both mo
2 CONC nastic and secular, the latter through the enforcement of the Vita Canoni
2 CONC ca or common life. Tithes were strictly enforced for the support of the c
2 CONC lergy and the dignity of public worship. Ecclesiastical immunities (q.v.
2 CONC ) were recognized and protected, the bishops held to frequent visitatio
2 CONC n of their dioceses, a regular religious instruction of the people provid
2 CONC ed for, and in the vernacular tongue. Through Alcuin he caused correcte
2 CONC d copies of the Scripture to be placed in the churches, and earned grea
2 CONC t credit for his improvement of the much depraved text of the Latin Vulga
2 CONC te. Education, for aspirants to the priesthood at least, was furthered b
2 CONC y the royal order of 787 to all bishops and abbots to keep open in thei
2 CONC r cathedrals and monasteries schools for the study of the seven liberal a
2 CONC rts and the interpretation of Scriptures. He did much also to improve ecc
2 CONC lesiastical music, and founded schools of church-song at Metz, Soissons
2 CONC , and St. Gall. For the contemporary development of Christian civilizatio
2 CONC n through Alcuin, Einhard, and other scholars, Italian and Irish, and fo
2 CONC r the king's personal attainments in literature, see CAROLINGIAN SCHOOLS
2 CONC ; ALCUIN; EINHARD. He spoke Latin well, and loved to listen to the readin
2 CONC g of St. Augustine, especially "The City of God". He understood Greek, bu
2 CONC t was especially devoted to his Frankish (Old-German) mother tongue; it
2 CONC s terms for the months and the various winds are owing to him. He attempt
2 CONC ed also to produce a German grammar, and Einhard tells us that he cause
2 CONC d the ancient folksongs and hero-tales (barbara atque antiquissima carmin
2 CONC a) to be collected; unfortunately this collection ceased to be appreciate
2 CONC d and was lost at a later date. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT From boyhood Charles had evinced strong domestic affections. Judged, per
2 CONC haps, by the more perfectly developed Christian standards of a later day
2 CONC , his matrimonial relations were far from blameless; but it would be unfa
2 CONC ir to criticize by any such ethical rules the obscurely transmitted accou
2 CONC nts of his domestic life which have come down to us. What is certain (an
2 CONC d more pleasant to contemplate) is the picture, which his contemporarie
2 CONC s have left us, of the delight he found in being with his children, joini
2 CONC ng in their sports, particularly in his own favourite recreation of swimm
2 CONC ing, and finding his relaxation in the society of his sons and daughters
2 CONC ; the latter he refused to give in marriage, unfortunately for their mora
2 CONC l character. He died in his seventy-second year, after forty-seven year
2 CONC s of reign, and was buried in the octagonal Byzantine-Romanesque church a
2 CONC t Aachen, built by him and decorated with marble columns from Rome and Ra
2 CONC venna. In the year 1000 Otto III opened the imperial tomb and found (it i
2 CONC s said) the great emperor as he had been buried, sitting on a marble thro
2 CONC ne, robed and crowned as in life, the book of the Gospels open on his kne
2 CONC es. In some parts of the empire popular affection placed him among the sa
2 CONC ints. For political purposes and to please Frederick Barbarossa he was ca
2 CONC nonized (1165) by the antipope Paschal III, but this act was never ratifi
2 CONC ed by insertion of his feast in the Roman Breviary or by the Universal Ch
2 CONC urch; his cultus, however, was permitted at Aachen [Acta SS., 28 Jan., 3
2 CONC d ed., II, 490-93, 303-7, 769; his office is in Canisius, "Antiq. Lect."
2 CONC , III (2)]. According to his friend and biographer, Einhard, Charles wa
2 CONC s of imposing stature, to which his bright eyes and long, flowing hair ad
2 CONC ded more dignity. His neck was rather short, and his belly prominent, bu
2 CONC t the symmetry of his other members concealed these defects. His clear vo
2 CONC ice was not so sonorous as his gigantic frame would suggest. Except on hi
2 CONC s visits to Rome he wore the national dress of his Frankish people, line
2 CONC n shirt and drawers, a tunic held by a silken cord, and leggings; his thi

2 CONT THOMAS J. SHAHAN / E. MACPHERSON From the Catholic Encyclopedia,
1 NOTE Charles has become known as Charles The Great or Charlemagne for very goo
2 CONC d reasons. His long reign changed the face of Europe politically and cult
2 CONC urally, and he himself would remain fixed in the minds of people in the M
2 CONC iddle Ages as the ideal king. In more recent times, many historians hav
2 CONC e taken his reign to be the beginning of the Middle Ages 'proper'. Yet i
2 CONC n terms of territorial expansion and consolidation, of church reform an
2 CONC d entanglement with Rome, Charlemagne's reign was merely bringing the pol
2 CONC icies of his father Pippin to their logical conclusions. Charlemagne beca
2 CONC me the subject of the first medieval biography of a layman, written by Ei
2 CONC nhard, one of his learned courtiers. Following his literary model, Sueton
2 CONC ius's word portrait of the Emperor Augustus, Einhard described Charlemagn
2 CONC e's appearance, his dress, his eating and drinking habits, his religiou
2 CONC s practices and intellectual interests, giving us a vivid if not perhap
2 CONC s entirely reliable picture of the Frankish monarch. He was strong, tall
2 CONC , and healthy, and ate moderately. He loved excercise: riding and hunting
2 CONC , and perhaps more surprising, swimming. Einhard tells us that he chose A
2 CONC achen as the site for his palace because of its hot springs, and that h
2 CONC e used to bathe there with his family, friends, and courtiers. He spoke a
2 CONC nd read Latin as well as his native Frankish, and could understand Greek
2 CONC , and even speak it a little. He learned grammar, rhetoric, amd mathemati
2 CONC cs from the learned clerics he gathered around him, but although he kep
2 CONC t writing-tablets under his pillow for practice (he used to wake up sever
2 CONC al times in the night) he never mastered the art of writing. It was becau
2 CONC se he was a tireless and remarkably successful general that he was able t
2 CONC o make such a mark upon European history. He concluded Pippin's wars wit
2 CONC h Aquitaine, and proclaimed his son Louis as king in 781; the one seriou
2 CONC s defeat he suffered was in these wars, at Roncevaux in the Pyrenees, a d
2 CONC efeat one day immortalized in "The Song of Roland" and later 'chansons d
2 CONC e geste'. He added Saxony to his realm after years of vicious campaigning
2 CONC ; and, towards the end of his reign, moving against the Danes; he destroy
2 CONC ed the kingdom of the Avars in Hungary; he subdued the Bretons, the Bavar
2 CONC ians, and various Slav people. In the south he began the reconquest of Sp
2 CONC ain from the Arabs and established the Spanish March in the north-east o
2 CONC f the peninsula. But perhaps his most significant campaigns were south o
2 CONC f the Alps, in Italy. Pope Hadrian appealed to Charlemagne for help again
2 CONC st Desiderius of the Lombards. The campaign in the winter of 773-4 was sh
2 CONC ort and decisive. Desiderius was exiled, and Charlemagne, "king of the Fr
2 CONC anks", added "and the Lombards" to his title; later he appointed his so
2 CONC n Pepin as King of Italy. But popes were still not free of all their enem
2 CONC ies. In 799 Leo III was ambushed by a rival party of Roman aristocrats, w
2 CONC ho tried to gouge out his eyes and cut off his tongue. Leo fled to Charle
2 CONC mage, who was at Paderborn preparing for another war against the Saxons
2 CONC . Charlemagne ordered Leo III to be restored and, later in the year 800
2 CONC , came to Rome himself. On Christmas Day, in St. Peter's, Pope Leo III cr
2 CONC owned Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans.

1 NOTE Emperor Conrad I had designated him as his successor and this was support
2 CONC ed by the Saxon and Franconian nobility. Although he was the first non-Fr
2 CONC ank ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, he nevertheless adopted Frankish cust
2 CONC oms, dress and manners. As he regarded the support of the nobility as suf
2 CONC ficient for his position, he refused to be crowned by the bishops. Also
2 CONC , as Duke of Saxony he had shown his independence from Emperor and Church
2 CONC ; yet, as Emperor himself, he grew closer to the church. The most seriou
2 CONC s problem of his reign was the independence of the higher nobility. Thi
2 CONC s had been caused by the disintegration of monarchical powers in the prec
2 CONC eeding fifty years. He re-established imperial control over Suabia, Lotha
2 CONC ringia and Bavaria. However, in general he allowed the dukes a free han
2 CONC d within their own territories. Several times after 925 he raided the ter
2 CONC ritories of his uncivilized neighbours, the Slavic Wends and the Hungaria
2 CONC n Magyars, taking Brandenburg from the Wends and, in 933, defeating the M
2 CONC agyars in battle. Then in the conquered lands he built fortified cities a
2 CONC s military strongholds. His rule restored much of the power and prestig
2 CONC e of the monarchy so that, before he died, he obtained the recognition o

2 CONT Queen of Germany, wife of King Henry I (The Fowler), b. at the Villa o
2 CONC f Engern in Westphalia, about 895; d. at Quedlinburg, 14 March, 968. Sh
2 CONC e was brought up at the monastery of Erfurt. Henry, whose marriage to a y
2 CONC oung widow, named Hathburg, had been declared invalid, asked for Matilda'
2 CONC s hand, and married her in 909 at Walhausen, which he presented to her a
2 CONC s a dowry. Matilda became the mother of: Otto I, Emperor of Germany; Henr
2 CONC y, Duke of Bavaria; St. Bruno, Archbishop of Cologne; Gerberga, who marri
2 CONC ed Louis IV of France; Hedwig, the mother of Hugh Capet. In 912 Matilda'
2 CONC s husband succeeded his father as Duke of Saxony, and in 918 he was chose
2 CONC n to succeed King Conrad of Germany. As queen, Matilda was humble, pious
2 CONC , and generous, and was always ready to help the oppressed and unfortunat
2 CONC e. She wielded a wholesome influence over the king. After a reign of seve
2 CONC nteen years, he died in 936. He bequeathed to her all his possessions i
2 CONC n Quedlinburg, Poehlden, Nordhausen, Grona, and Duderstadt. 
2 CONT It was the king's wish that his eldest son, Otto, should succeed him. Ma
2 CONC tilda wanted her favourite son Henry on the royal throne. On the plea tha
2 CONC t he was the first-born son after his father became king, she induced a f
2 CONC ew nobles to cast their vote for him, but Otto was elected and crowned ki
2 CONC ng on 8 August, 936. Three years later Henry revolted against his brothe
2 CONC r Otto, but, being unable to wrest the royal crown from him, submitted, a
2 CONC nd upon the intercession of Matilda was made Duke of Bavaria. Soon, howev
2 CONC er, the two brothers joined in persecuting their mother, whom they accuse
2 CONC d of having impoverished the crown by her lavish almsgiving. To satisfy t
2 CONC hem, she renounced the possessions the deceased king had bequeathed to he
2 CONC r, and retired to her villa at Engern in Westphalia. But afterwards, whe
2 CONC n misfortune overtook her sons, Matilda was called back to the palace, an
2 CONC d both Otto and Henry implored her pardon. 
2 CONT Matilda built many churches, and founded or supported numerous monasteri
2 CONC es. Her chief foundations were the monasteries at Quedlinburg, Nordhausen
2 CONC , Engern, and Poehlden. She spent many days at these monasteries and wa
2 CONC s especially fond of Nordhausen. She died at the convents of Sts. Servati
2 CONC us and Dionysius at Quedlinburg, and was buried there by the side of he
2 CONC r husband. She was venerated as a saint immediately after her death. He
2 CONC r feast is celebrated on 14 March. 
2 CONT Two old Lives of Matilda are extant; one, Vita antiquior, written in th
2 CONC e monastery of Nordhausen and dedicated to the Emperor Otto II; edited b
2 CONC y KOEPKE in Mon. Germ. Script., X, 575-582, and reprinted in MIGNE, P.L.

2 CONC s father Alfred and upstaged by his son Athelstan, it was Edward who reco
2 CONC nquered much of England from the Danes (909-919), established an administ
2 CONC ration for the kingdom of England, and secured the allegiance of Danes, S
2 CONC cots, Britons, and English. Using Alfred's methods and in alliance with M
2 CONC ercia, he spread English influence and control. The Danes of Northumbri
2 CONC a were defeated (910) at Tettenhall (in Staffordshire), the Viking kingdo
2 CONC m of York acknowledged his power in 918, and most Welsh kings submitted t
2 CONC o him. In 921 the submission of not only Viking York and Northumbria bu
2 CONC t also of the kings of Strathclyde and of the Scots gave his kingdom prim
2 CONC acy in the British Isles. Edward was a patient planner, systematic organi

1 NOTE About 1081 he married Adela of Normandy, the formidable daughter of Willi
2 CONC am The Conqueror, and by her fathered seven children. When Stephen's fath
2 CONC er died in 1090 he became Count of Blois and Chartres.In 1095 Adela becam
2 CONC e Regent when her husband took part in the first crusade. He had no enthu
2 CONC siasm for this duty but Adela considered that he ought to go, so he went
2 CONC . There was never any nonsense in their household about who made the deci
2 CONC sions---she did. Stephen de Blois went together with Adela's brother, Rob
2 CONC ert, Duke of Normandy. Having marched south through Italy, Stephen and hi
2 CONC s brother-in-law decided to spend the winter comfortably in southern Ital
2 CONC y before continuing on their way. When at last these two leaders decide
2 CONC d to embark their men at Brindisi, disaster struck them. It was a very me
2 CONC diaeval kind of disaster: the first ship to leave port capsized and san
2 CONC k with the loss of all hands together with many pack-animals, stores, an
2 CONC d chests of money. Most of their armies allowed themselves to be shippe
2 CONC d and, after a rough and unpleasant crossing, they reached Constantinopl
2 CONC e in May 1096. Stephen de Blois was impressed by the city but reserved hi
2 CONC s greatest admiration for the Emperor Alexius. "Your father, my beloved,
2 CONC " he wrote to Adela, "made many gifts, but he was almost nothing compare
2 CONC d with this man". One cannot help but wonder how the formidable Adela rea
2 CONC cted to this remark about her father, William the Conqueror; however, sin
2 CONC ce her husband was the better part of two thousand miles away, perhaps fo
2 CONC r once he himself did not much mind how she reacted. Godfrey of Bouillo
2 CONC n had attacked the city of Nicaea and was joined, in early June 1096, b
2 CONC y Stephen de Blois, Robert of Normandy and Raymond of Toulouse. They cele
2 CONC brated their assault by cutting off the heads of as many Turks as they co
2 CONC uld find and catapulting them over the city walls into the streets. Other
2 CONC s were set up on spikes in front of the gates in full view of the depress
2 CONC ed defenders. A Byzantine force took control of the city and deprived th
2 CONC e crusaders of another massacre by allowing the Turks to escape. Stephe
2 CONC n wrote to his wife in high spirits: "In five weeks' time we shall be i
2 CONC n Jerusalem, unless we are held up at Antioch". After the joint crusader-
2 CONC force defeated another Turkish army, the retreating Turks laid waste to t
2 CONC he country, burning the crops and destroying or befouling the wells. Th
2 CONC e weather was still painfully hot and it was not long before hunger and t
2 CONC hirst began to take their toll. Stephen wrote to Adela to say that it wa
2 CONC s a great mistake to imagine that the sun always shone in Syria, for "thr
2 CONC oughout this winter we have endured intense cold and incessant rain". Lat
2 CONC er Stephen marched his men to Alexandretta as he saw no point in having t
2 CONC hem massacred by the Atabeg of Mosul. Afterwards he was to be rebuked bit
2 CONC terly for this 'cowardice' by the formidable Adela. He returned to Franc
2 CONC e in 1099 but was forced by the inexorable Adela to return to the East, t
2 CONC here to redeem his tarnished reputation which he did by being killed in t
2 CONC he Battle of Ramleh.

1 NOTE Adela of Normandy, daughter of William the Conqueror, was the mother of S
2 CONC tephen, King of England, whose right to the throne derived through her. S
2 CONC he was married to Stephen, Count of Meaux en Brie. Upon the death of hi
2 CONC s father in 1090, her husband succeeded to the counties of Blois and Char
2 CONC tres. She took an active interest in civil and ecclesiastical affairs an
2 CONC d was instrumental in rebuilding the cathedral of Chartres in stone. In 1
2 CONC 095 Adela became Regent when her husband took part in the first crusade
2 CONC . He had no enthusiasm for this duty but Adela considered that he ought t
2 CONC o go, so he went. There was never any nonsense in their household about w
2 CONC ho made the decisions---she did. Stephen de Blois went together with Adel
2 CONC a's brother, Robert, Duke of Normandy. In 1099, Stephen returned to Franc
2 CONC e but was forced by Adela to return to the East to redeem his, accordin
2 CONC g to Adela, 'tarnished' reputation, which he did by being killed in the b
2 CONC attle of Ramleh, on 19 May 1102. Adela continued as Regent during the min
2 CONC ority of her sons and was increasingly active in public life. Anselm, he
2 CONC r guest and teacher in 1097, was often entertained by her during 1103 an
2 CONC d 1105. Consequently she affected a temporary reconciliation between hi
2 CONC m and her brother, King Henry I of England. In 1107 Adela entertained Pop
2 CONC e Pascal during Easter and the following year was hostess to Boemund of A
2 CONC ntiochia. She made her son Thibaud her successor in 1109 and entered a co
2 CONC nvent in the diocese of Autun. Here she continued to wield an important i
2 CONC nfluence in public and clerical affairs. She persuaded Thibaut to join he
2 CONC r brother, Henri I, against France in 1117 and was a benevolent patrones
2 CONC s of churches and monasteries. She died in 1137 and was buried at Caen.

1 NOTE He was born at Falaise, the bastard son of Robert, Duke of Normandy, by A
2 CONC rlette, a tanner's daughter. On his father's death in 1035, the nobles ac
2 CONC cepted him as duke, but his youth was passed in difficulty and danger. Wh
2 CONC en in 1047 the lords of the western part of the duchy rebelled, Henri I o
2 CONC f France came to his help and the rebels were defeated at Val-des-Dunes
2 CONC . In 1051 he visited his cousin, Edward the Confessor, and received the p
2 CONC romise of the English succession. He married Matilda, daughter of Baudoui
2 CONC n V, Count of Flanders, in 1053. In the next ten years William repulsed t
2 CONC wo French invasions, and in 1063 conquered Maine. Although he was never k
2 CONC een on actual capital punishment, William the Bastard could get touchy ab
2 CONC out jokes too near the bone and, when he captured the town of Alencon tha
2 CONC t had displayed flayed skins on its walls in allusion to the tanner's tra
2 CONC de (his maternal grandfather, Fulbert, had been a tanner), he chopped th
2 CONC e right hand and left foot off each citizen to teach them a lesson abou
2 CONC t laughing last. Probably in 1064, Harold was at his court and swore to h
2 CONC elp him gain the English crown on Edward's death. When, however, Edward d
2 CONC ied in 1066, Harold became king. William laid his claim and, on October 1
2 CONC 4, defeated Harold at the battle of Hastings or Senlac. Harold was slai
2 CONC n and William was crowned on December 25. The west and north of England w
2 CONC ere subdued in 1068; but next year the north revolted, and William devast
2 CONC ated the country between York and Durham. The constitution under Willia
2 CONC m assumed a feudal aspect, the old national assembly becoming a council o
2 CONC f the king's tenants-in-chief, and all title to land being derived from h
2 CONC is grant. The Domesday Book contains the land settlement. He also brough

2 CONC e was stern and orderly. In 1070 there was a rebellion in the Fen Countr

2 CONC tish king, Malcolm, who plundered the northern shires; but William in 107
2 CONC 2 compelled Malcolm to do him homage at Abernethy. In 1073 he reconquere

1 NOTE was of very small stature and very little is known about her early years
2 CONC . Being a descendant of the English King Alfred The Great was one reaso
2 CONC n why William, Duke of Normandy, sought her in marriage. Apparently she r
2 CONC efused him as she did not want to be married to a bastard. Furious, Willi
2 CONC am forced entry to her room and gave her a beating. However, this rathe
2 CONC r unconventional behaviour resulted in her changing her mind and they mar
2 CONC ried in 1051, although they had to wait until 1059 before the papal dispe
2 CONC nsation arrived. William relied heavily on her and she acted as regent i
2 CONC n Normandy whenever he was absent. After the conquest of England, she wa
2 CONC s crowned William The Conqueror's queen at Winchester. She went to the no
2 CONC rth of England with him and at Selby gave birth to the future King Henr
2 CONC y I, probably their tenth or eleventh child. In the year 1069 she went ba
2 CONC ck to the Duchy of Normandy where she remained in charge. When she becam
2 CONC e ill in 1083, William The Conqueror hurried over from England to be wit
2 CONC h her. However, she died on 2 November 1083 at Caen and was buried there

1 NOTE The area now known as Holland was formerly known as Friesland, or West-Fr
2 CONC iesland, and its first counts were entitled Count of Friesland. At that t
2 CONC ime, Friesland covered the area from the mouth of the river Weser (near G
2 CONC ermany's Bremen) to nearly inside modern Belgium. Today this area is divi
2 CONC ded into five provinces: Zeeland, South-Holland, North-Holland, Frieslan
2 CONC d and Groningen. However, the area ruled over by these counts was onl
2 CONC y a very small section of the total. From when the first known count live
2 CONC d around the year 889, it took until 1100 before his descendants became k
2 CONC nown as Counts of Holland. Apparently the name Holland was derived from t
2 CONC he word 'Holtland', which meant either 'Land with a hollow' or 'wood (hou
2 CONC t/holt) land'. In 922, Count Dirk I received (from Charles The Simple, Ki
2 CONC ng of the West-Franks, or France) the church in Egmond and its estates wh
2 CONC ich became the centre of his county. In 925, while formally belonging t
2 CONC o the Lorraine area, Holland became part of the Holy Roman Empire. Howeve
2 CONC r, the Count and his subjects preferred to think themselves independent o
2 CONC f any overlord; accordingly they made their own alliances as they saw fit

2 NOTE There are very few families where nationality and religion played suc
3 CONC h a critical part of its history as it is with the Melanson/Melançon. I
3 CONC n Louisiana and perhaps elsewhere, it is considered an "old" French name
3 CONC . In fact, it is not French, but rather a "Gallicized" version of the Eng
3 CONC lish name, Mellison. 
3 CONT The story begins with the fall of LaRochelle in 1628 when the Calvinist
3 CONC s were forced to leave France. One of these Calvinists was Pierre Laverdu
3 CONC re. He went to England and married Priscilla Mellison in 1630. They had t
3 CONC hree sons, Pierre, Charles, and John. In 1657 the entire family boarded t
3 CONC he vessel "Satisfaction" under the command of Peter Butler. They formed p
3 CONC art of the company which Thomas Temple, the new Governor of English Nov
3 CONC a Scotia, was transporting to Acadia. Pierre and Priscilla settled in Aca
3 CONC dia. Two of their sons married into the French Acadian families already t
3 CONC here. England ceded Acadia back to France in 1667 in the Treaty of Breda
3 CONC . Pierre, his wife, and youngest son, John left for Boston, seeking refug
3 CONC e in Protestant New England "from the wrath of his Countrymen Papists, a
3 CONC t Johns fort and thereabouts." The two older Melanson sons remained in Ac
3 CONC adia after 1667. The elder Pierre had to leave all his property in Acadi
3 CONC a when he left for Boston, and thus was forced to live in extreme poverty
3 CONC . His son, John, was the only support for the family. John quickly ran in
3 CONC to problems of his own. In late 1676, he and Henry Lawton tricked some In
3 CONC dians from near Cape Sable, Acadia onto a vessel so they could sell the
3 CONC m as slaves on Fayal Island. Seventeen Indians, men, women, and childre
3 CONC n were involved. This behavior was illegal, and they were arrested. Joh
3 CONC n was granted temporary leave (bail) for 100 pounds supplied by Samuel Se
3 CONC ndall, whom his mother referred to as her landlord. John never made it t
3 CONC o trial and disappeared. His father, Pierre Laverdure searched for him a
3 CONC s far as Acadia but never found him. The journeys weakened the elderly Pi
3 CONC erre, and he died in 1677. His widow, Priscilla, was obligated to repay t
3 CONC he 100 pounds to her landlord and came to depend on public charity. She m
3 CONC arried Captain William Wright, an innkeeper from Dorchester, Massachusett
3 CONC s on April 8, 1680 . Priscilla had sent for a granddaughter still livin
3 CONC g in Acadia, Marie Melanson.. Marie was the daughter of her son, Charles
3 CONC , who had married an Acadian and remained in Acadia. She raised Marie i
3 CONC n the Protestant religion in Massachusetts. Her son sent his daughter t
3 CONC o Massachusetts along with a loan of 40 pounds upon a promise that Mari
3 CONC e would get all of Priscilla's household belongings upon her death. Prisc
3 CONC illa's belongings were inventoried, and this inventory can be found in th
3 CONC e Mass. archives (Vol. 37). Marie eventually married David Basset. It app
3 CONC ears that when Priscilla died in late 1691 or 1692, while in her early ni
3 CONC neties, Captain Wright wanted to keep the pots and pans only to be sued b
3 CONC y the granddaughter, Marie. The suit was presumably settled out of court
3 CONC . Meanwhile, the two "Catholic sons" were raising their families in Acadi
3 CONC a. The oldest of the two sons who remained in Acadia was Pierre. He was b
3 CONC orn in or around 1632 and married Marie Marguerite Anne Mius d'Entremon
3 CONC t at Port Royal in 1665. He apparently remained in contact with Boston, b
3 CONC ecause he borrowed 3000 pounds from his nephew-in-law, David Basset. Pier
3 CONC re had 10 children, 6 girls and 4 boys.

2 NOTE In 1631, Charles de La Tour gave to Philippe Mius d'Entremont the choic

3 CONC e to fish). Charles La Tour erected the place into a barony, the first ev
3 CONC er constituted in Acadia, and the second in all Canada. He gave to Philip
3 CONC pe Mius d'Entremont the title of Baron. The centre of the barony was loca
3 CONC ted on the east side of the harbour, not far from its head. It was at thi

1 NOTE MIUS (Muis) DENTREMONT, PHILIPPE, baron de POBOMCOUP (Pubnico), près d
2 CONC u cap de Sable, lieutenant-major, procureur du roi, colon, le premier de
2 CONC s dEntremont de la Nouvelle-Écosse, né en Normandie (probablement à Cher
2 CONC bourg) vers 1601 (ou 1609), décédé vers 1700 (ou 1701) en Acadie.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Daprès Placide Gaudet, le normand Philippe Mius avait des affinit
2 CONC és avec la famille Bourbon et fut créé sieur dEntremont par Louis XI
2 CONC V ; mais daprès un descendant, H. Léandre dEntremont, les titres de nob
2 CONC lesse remonteraient au xie siècle, en Savoie, et une branche de la famill
2 CONC e savoyarde aurait émigré en Normandie au, cours du xvie siècle. En 1649
2 CONC , le sieur dEntremont épousait Madeleine Hélie (ou Élie) Du Tillet, né
2 CONC e en 1626. Il était alors capitaine dans un régiment. Cest en 1650 (Coll
2 CONC . de manuscrits relatifs à la Nouv.-France, II : 329) ou 1651 (R. Le Blan
2 CONC t) quil fut amené en Acadie avec son épouse et une fille par le nouvea
2 CONC u gouverneur, Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour, un ami denfance, comm
2 CONC e lieutenant-major et commandant des troupes du roi. Pour le récompense
2 CONC r de ses services, La Tour, par des lettres patentes, en 1651 ou 1653, of
2 CONC frait à dEntremont le fief Pobomcoup à titre de baronnie. Les droits féo
2 CONC daux conféraient au baron un territoire sétendant du cap Nègre au cap Fo
2 CONC urchu (Yarmouth, N.-É.). Le château féodal fut érigé près de lentrée d
2 CONC u havre naturel de Pobomcoup, du côté est.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       DEntremont joua un rôle important dans lhistoire de la colonie s
2 CONC oit par ses fonctions administratives, soit du fait quil fut lun des ra
2 CONC res seigneurs acadiens à soccuper de culture et de défrichement ; il att
2 CONC ira sur son domaine « plusieurs engagés et quelques familles de Port-Roya
2 CONC l, et cette seigneurie finit par former un petit centre de population ».
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Outre leur fille quils avaient amenée de France, les dEntremon
2 CONC t donnèrent naissance à quatre enfants en terre acadienne : deux des fils
2 CONC , Jacques, né en 1659, et Abraham, de Plemazais (ou Plemarch), né en 166
2 CONC 1 ou 1662, épousèrent les filles du »gouverneur Charles de La Tour et d
2 CONC e Jeanne Motin, Anne et Marguerite ; le troisième fils, Philippe, dont l
2 CONC a vie est plus difficile à retracer, épousa en 1707 une fille de Jean-Vin
2 CONC cent dAbbadie* de Saint-Castin. Quant aux filles, Marie-Marguerite, né
2 CONC e en France, épousa Pierre Melanson, dit La Verdure [V. Charles Melanson
2 CONC ] ; et il semble que lautre, Madeleine, soit restée célibataire.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Vers 1670, au moment où le traité de Bréda était mis en vigueur, l
2 CONC e gouverneur dAndigné de Grandfontaine sétablissait à Pentagouet (sur l
2 CONC a Penobscot). DEntremont fut nommé procureur du roi, charge quil exerç
2 CONC a pendant 18 ans malgré son âge avancé. On connaît des rapports de Mius d
2 CONC Entremont et de Jacques Bourgeois* sur les frontières de lAcadie qui fu
2 CONC rent envoyés au ministre Pontchartrain par Joseph Robinau de Villebon. Ve
2 CONC rs la fin de sa vie, dEntremont quitta son domaine seigneurial, léguan
2 CONC t le titre de baron de Pobomcoup à son aîné, Jacques, et vint sétabli
2 CONC r à Port-Royal avec son épouse et deux de ses enfants. Vénérable patriarc
2 CONC he, il décédait à la fin de 1700 ou au début de 1701, âgé de plus de 90 a
2 CONC ns. Daprès la tradition, cest à Port-Royal quil mourut, mais Léandre d
2 CONC Entremont indique plutôt comme lieu du décès Grand-Pré, où il se serai
2 CONC t retiré chez sa fille Marie-Marguerite Melanson. Philippe Mius dEntremo
2 CONC nt a laissé en Acadie une nombreuse postérité ; la baronnie de Pobomcou
2 CONC p resta à la famille jusquà la dispersion des Acadiens ; et, après plu
2 CONC s de trois siècles, on compte encore à Pubnico une centaine de familles d
2 CONC u même nom.

1 NOTE BOURG, dit Belle-Humeur, ALEXANDRE, notaire, procureur du roi, né en 167
2 CONC 1 à Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, N.-É.), fils de François Bourg et de Mar
2 CONC guerite Boudrot, décédé à Richibouctou, (Richibucto, N.-B.) en 1760.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Vers 1694, Alexandre Bourg sétablit à Grand-Pré (N.-É.) où il épo
2 CONC usa Marguerite Melanson, fille de Pierre Melanson, dit La Verdure, et d
2 CONC e Marguerite Mius dEntremont ; de ce mariage naquirent au moins 16 enfan
2 CONC ts. Au lendemain de la conquête de lAcadie en 1710 par les Anglais, il f
2 CONC ut nommé notaire pour le bassin des Mines. À plusieurs reprises, il fut c
2 CONC hoisi pour représenter les Acadiens de sa région auprès du gouvernement d
2 CONC Annapolis Royal. Ainsi en 1720, il est mentionné au nombre des délégué
2 CONC s que le gouverneur Richard Philipps avait demandé aux Acadiens des Mine
2 CONC s denvoyer à Annapolis après les avoir priés de devenir sujets britanniq
2 CONC ues. De même en 1727, à la suite du refus de ces mêmes Acadiens de prête
2 CONC r le serment, il fut appelé à Annapolis pour expliquer leur conduite.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En décembre 1730, le gouverneur Philipps octroya à Alexandre Bour
2 CONC g la commission de procureur du roi aux Mines, à Pisiquid (Windsor, N.-É.
2 CONC ), à Cobequid (près de Truro, N.-É.), et à Chignectou, avec mandat de per
2 CONC cevoir les dûs et rentes et de soccuper de toutes confiscations et aubai
2 CONC nes. On laccusa dès 1731 de négligence dans ses comptes, et le lieutenan
2 CONC t-gouverneur Lawrence Armstrong* le démit de ses fonctions en septembre 1
2 CONC 737 ; François Mangeant, dit Saint-Germain, lui succéda. Considérant Bour
2 CONC g comme une vieille connaissance, Paul Mascarene, à peine entré en foncti
2 CONC on comme successeur dArmstrong, le réintégra le 27 mai 1740 dans la char
2 CONC ge de notaire et de percepteur.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       En 1742 Bourg et quelques habitants des Mines aidèrent à retrouve
2 CONC r des effets volés par les Indiens à bord dun navire marchand anglais pr
2 CONC ès de Grand-Pré. Accusé de nouveau en 1744 de négligence dans laccomplis
2 CONC sement de ses fonctions et davoir même collaboré, lui et son gendre, Jos
2 CONC eph Leblanc, dit Le Maigre, avec les troupes de François Du Pont* Duvivie
2 CONC r lors de linvasion de la péninsule acadienne, Bourg se vit suspendu d
2 CONC e sa charge le 17 décembre. Il fut conduit à Annapolis Royal en compagni
2 CONC e de Joseph Leblanc et soumis à un interrogatoire serré de la part de Mas
2 CONC carene et de son conseil. Pour châtiment, on lui enleva définitivement so
2 CONC n poste de notaire des Mines.
2 CONT 
2 CONT       Bourg a peut-être quitté lAcadie au début des années 50 lorsque p
2 CONC lusieurs milliers dAcadiens émigrèrent aux îles Royale (île du Cap-breto
2 CONC n) et Saint-Jean (Île-du-Prince-Édouard). Quoi quil en soit, nous le ret
2 CONC rouvons en 1752 à Port-Toulouse (St Peters, N.-É.), chez Joseph Leblanc q
2 CONC ui sy trouvait depuis trois ans. Bourg échappa à la déportation des Acad
2 CONC iens en 1755 et à lévacuation de lîle Royale après la chute de Louisbou
2 CONC rg aux mains des Anglais en 1758 [V. Wolfe]. Il semble sêtre réfugié à R
2 CONC ichibouctou, oû il mourut en 1760 à lâge de 89 ans

2 NOTE Pieter Casparszen (Mabie) Van Naerden (living between 1647 and 1662) wa
3 CONC s identified with a Batavian alias which assigned the town of his origi
3 CONC n as a last name. So literally, he was Peter, son of Caspar, of Naerden
3 CONC , Holland and only occasionally did he use the surname Mabie. He was clos
3 CONC ely associated with the Ryck family at New Amsterdam. He married Aechte J
3 CONC ans, the former wife of Abraham Willemszen Ryck (d.1651) and they were th
3 CONC e parents of six children: Marritien, Jan, Engeltie, Metje, Caspar and Tr
3 CONC yntie. He may possibly have had a first family which went by the surnam
3 CONC e Van Naerden including: Sarah Pieterse, Elizabeth Pieterse and Pieter Pi
3 CONC eterse. The later Pieter was the father of Caspar and Pieterse (of the Sc
3 CONC henectady family) and Hendrick Pieterse. Several genealogical angles ar

1 NOTE His father's only surviving son, he was crowned emperor by his father i
2 CONC n 813 without assistance from the clergy. However, in 816 he was anointe
2 CONC d by the pope, implying that the honour depended upon the pope. In 817 h
2 CONC e issued the "Ordinatio Imperii" which effectively divided the Empire bet
2 CONC ween his three sons. However, this was not the only reason for the disint
2 CONC egration of the Carolingian Empire. High offices had become hereditary an
2 CONC d so less subject to the Emperor's favour. As well, the Vikings began rai
2 CONC ding the Empire more frequently. Just as Charlemagne had been a Frankis
2 CONC h warrior, Louis saw himself as a servant of the Church. As a result, whe
2 CONC re the papal elections had previously required the imperial approval, thi
2 CONC s was no longer the case under the rule of Louis the Pious. In 817 he bru
2 CONC tally suppressed his nephew, Bernard of Italy; however, feeling guilty ab
2 CONC out the brutality, in 821 he pardoned those involved in the uprising, onl
2 CONC y to have this public confession about his guilt interpreted by the Frank
2 CONC ish nobles in 822 as a sign of weakness. By now he had lost control ove
2 CONC r both church and nobility and, as well, as a widower he had married agai
2 CONC n and a fourth son was born. Now he was also going to be plagued by dynas
2 CONC tic problems. His second wife, Judith, wanting the largest part of the em
2 CONC pire for her son, joined forces with Louis's sons, Ludwig the German an
2 CONC d Pippin, against Lothar, the eldest son. The results were that two facti
2 CONC ons developed in the Empire, one wanting to keep the Empire united and th
2 CONC e other to continue the Frankish custom of dividing lands between all son
2 CONC s. In 829 Judith pursuaded Louis the Pious to set aside his settlement o
2 CONC f 817 and include Judith's son, Charles, in the partition of the Empire
2 CONC . However, Ludwig the German and Pippin, jealous of Charles's portion, jo
2 CONC ined forces with Lothar, their eldest brother and, in 830, rebelled again
2 CONC st their father. The eldest three sons, supported by Pope Gregory IV, def
2 CONC eated their father in 833. Lothar was restored as Emperor designate and L
2 CONC ouis the Pious was forced to perform a humiliating penance. However, Ludw
2 CONC ig the German and Pippin were still dissatisfied and again took up arms
2 CONC . In 838 Pippin died followed, in 840, by Louis the Pious; but it took un
2 CONC til 843 when, at Verdun, the Frankish tradition triumphed and the Empir
2 CONC e was divided between the three surviving sons.

1 NOTE The Magyars had lived in the Khazar state north of the Black sea to wher
2 CONC e they had migrated earlier, probably from the area between the great ben
2 CONC d of the Volga River and the Ural Mountains. Around 889, or perhaps a fe
2 CONC w years earlier, they were defeated and forced to leave their traditiona
2 CONC l grounds. Their shamanist priests decided on a mass emigration; but firs
2 CONC t, to pacify their God, Isten "creator of all created things", a sacrific
2 CONC e was needed, a supreme sacrifice. The princes leading the seven tribes c
2 CONC hose Almos, the most able and senior amongst them, to be the Chief of al
2 CONC l Magyars. Then they opened their veins in their arms and each drank th
2 CONC e mingled blood of all and they took five vows. The first was: "As long a
2 CONC s they and their progeny after them shall live, their duke and ruler shal
2 CONC l always be taken from the House of Almos. Then Duke Almos, as the best p
2 CONC ossession they had, was a willing and honoured sacrifice to their god Ist
2 CONC en. The Magyars then set out under their new leader, Duke Arpad, the so
2 CONC n of Almos. After many raiding parties into the area now known as Hungary
2 CONC , they settled there, ethnically and linguistically isolated from their n
2 CONC eighbours. These early Magyars had been seven semi-nomadic tribes who ass
2 CONC ociated loosely for offence as well as defence. Consequently they were wa
2 CONC rlike and bent upon conquest and plunder. Their move to Hungary was unde
2 CONC r the leadership of Arpad, the first elected chieftain of all the seven t
2 CONC ribes. Being semi-nomadic, they considered the Carpathian Basin as onl
2 CONC y a base for operations. The pastoral section of these tribes would her
2 CONC d their cattle from mountain pastures in summer to milder lowlands in win
2 CONC ter. At the same time the more war-like Magyars would maraud from Constan
2 CONC tinople to the North Sea, and from southern Italy to the Pyrenees, return
2 CONC ing with booty while at the same time leaving behind a resentment resulti
2 CONC ng in a catastrophic defeat at Augsburg. This was a turning point in th
2 CONC e history of Hungary as from then onwards they not only became more settl
2 CONC ed but began to identify with their adopted country.

1 NOTE Leo was recorded to be a son of Basil I the Macedonian and his second wif
2 CONC e, Eudokia Ingerina. However, it is regarded that he is the son of Empero
2 CONC r Michael III, as his mother had been this Emperor's mistress. Educated b
2 CONC y the patriarch Photius, Leo was more of a scholar than a soldier. In add
2 CONC ition to completing the canon of laws, Leo wrote several decrees (novels
2 CONC ) dealing with a wide range of ecclesiastical and secular problems. His o
2 CONC ther works include a funeral panegyric on his father, liturgical poems, s
2 CONC ermons and orations, secular poetry, and military treatises. His imperia
2 CONC l laws, written in Greek, became the legal code of the Byzantine Empire
2 CONC . Made co-Emperor in 870, he succeeded to the throne on his father's deat
2 CONC h. His foreign policy was directed mainly against the Arabs and the Bulga
2 CONC rs. The able commander Nicephorus Phocas the Elder was recalled from hi
2 CONC s successful campaigns against the Lombards in south Italy to assist in t
2 CONC he Balkans. After Byzantium met with reverses in the West, Sicily was los
2 CONC t to the Arabs in 902, Thessalonica was sacked by Leo of Tripoli, and th
2 CONC e Aegean was open to constant attack from Arab pirates. Steps were take
2 CONC n to strengthen the Byzantine navy, which successfully attacked the Ara
2 CONC b fleet in the Aegean in 908. But the naval expedition of 911-912 was def
2 CONC eated by Leo of Tripoli. Byzantium's enemy to the north was Simeon, the B
2 CONC ulgar ruler. Hostilities arose out of a trade dispute in 894 and the Byza
2 CONC ntines, aided by the Magyars of the Danube-Dnieper region, forced Simeo
2 CONC n to agree to a truce. However, in 896 with the help of the nomadic Peche
2 CONC negs, Simeon took revenge on the Byzantines, forcing them to pay an annua
2 CONC l tribute to the Bulgars. During Leo's reign the Russian prince Oleg sail
2 CONC ed to Constantinople and in 907 obtained a treaty regulating the positio
2 CONC n of Russian merchants in Byzantium, which was formally ratified in 911
2 CONC . Because of his anxiety for a male heir Leo married four times, thus inc
2 CONC urring the censure of the church.

1 NOTE St. Clotilda(Fr. CLOTILDE; Ger. CHLOTHILDE).Queen of the Franks, born pro
2 CONC bably at Lyons, c. 474; died at Tours, 3 June, 545. Her feast is celebrat
2 CONC ed 3 June. Clotilda was the wife of Clovis I, and the daughter of Chilper
2 CONC ic, King of Burgundians of Lyons, and Caretena. After the death of King G
2 CONC undovic (Gundioch), the Kingdom of Burgundy had been divided among his fo
2 CONC ur sons, Chilperic reigning at Lyons, Gondebad at Vienne, and Godegisil a
2 CONC t Geneva; Gondemar's capital is not mentioned. Chilperic and probably God
2 CONC egisil were Catholics, while Gondebad professed Arianism. Clotilda was gi
2 CONC ven a religious training by her mother caretena, who, according to Sidoni
2 CONC us Apollinaris and Fortunatus of Poitiers, was a remarkable woman. Afte
2 CONC r the death of Chilperic, Caretena seems to have made her home with Godeg
2 CONC isil at Geneva, where her other daughter, Sedeleuba, or Chrona, founded t
2 CONC he church of Saint-Victor, and took the religious habit. It was soon afte
2 CONC r the death of Chilperic that Clovis asked and obtained the hand of Cloti
2 CONC lda. 
2 CONT From the sixth century on, the marriage of Clovic and Clotilda was mad
2 CONC e the theme of epic narratives, in which the original facts vere material
2 CONC ly altered and the various versions found their way into the works of dif
2 CONC ferent Frankish chroniclers, e. g. Gregory of Tours, Fredegarius, and th
2 CONC e "Liber Historiae". These narratives have the character common to all nu
2 CONC ptial poems of the rude epic poetry found among many of the Germanic peop
2 CONC les. Here it will suffice to summarize the legends and add a brief statem
2 CONC ent of the historical facts. Further information will be found in specia
2 CONC l works on the subject. The popular poems substituted for King Godegisil
2 CONC , uncle and protector of Clotilda, his brother Gondebad, who was represen
2 CONC ted as the persecutor of the young princess. Gondebad is supposed to hav
2 CONC e slain Chilperic, thrown his wife into a well, with a stone tied aroun
2 CONC d her neck, and exiled her two daughters. Clovis, on hearing of the beaut
2 CONC y of Clotilda, sent his friend Aurelian, disguised as a beggar, to visi
2 CONC t her secretly, and give her a gold ring from his master; he then asked G
2 CONC ondebad for the hand of the young princess. Gondebad, fearing the powerfu
2 CONC l King of the Franks, dared not refuse, and Clotilda accompanied Aurelia
2 CONC n and his escort on their return journey. They hastened to reach Frankis
2 CONC h territory, as Clotilda feared that Aredius, the faithful counsellor o
2 CONC f Gondebad, on his return from Constantinople whither he had been sent o
2 CONC n a mission, would influence his master to retract his promise. Her fear
2 CONC s were justified. Shortly after the departure of the princess, Aredius re
2 CONC turned and caused Gondebad to repent to the marriage. Troops were despatc
2 CONC hed to bring Clotilda back, but it was too late, as she was safe on Frank
2 CONC ish soil. The details of this recital are purely legendary. It is histori
2 CONC cally established that Chilperic's death was lamented by Gondebad, and th
2 CONC at Cartena lived until 506: she died "full of days", says her epitaph, ha
2 CONC ving had the joy of seeing her children brought up in catholic religion
2 CONC . Aurelian and Aredius are historical personages, though little is know
2 CONC n of them in the legend is highly improbable. 
2 CONT Clotilda, as wife of Clovis, soon acquired a great ascendancy over him
2 CONC , of which she availed herself to exhort him to embrace the Catholic Fait
2 CONC h. For a long time her efforts were fruitless, though the king permitte
2 CONC d the baptism of Ingomir, their first son. The child died in his infanc
2 CONC y which seemed to give Clovis an argument against the God of Clotilda, bu
2 CONC t notwithstanding this, the young queen again obtained the consent of he
2 CONC r husband to the baptism of their second son, Clodomir. Thus the future o
2 CONC f Catholicism was already assured in the Frankish Kingdom. Clovis himsel
2 CONC f was soon afterwards converted under highly dramatic circumstances, an
2 CONC d was baptized at Reims by St. Remigius, in 496 (see CLOVIS). Thus Clotil
2 CONC das accomplished the mission assigned her by Providence; she was made th
2 CONC e instrument in the conversion of a great people, who were to be for cent
2 CONC uries the leaders of Catholic civilization. Clotilda bore Clovis five chi
2 CONC ldren: four sons, Ingomir, who died in infancy, and Kings Clodomir, Child
2 CONC ebert, and Clotaire, and one daughter, named Clotilda after her mother. L
2 CONC ittle more is known of Queen Clotilda during the lifetime of husband, bu
2 CONC t it may be conjectured that she interceded with him, at the time of hi
2 CONC s intervention in the quarrel between the Burgundian kings, to win him t
2 CONC o the cause of Godegisil as against Gondebad. The moderation displayed b
2 CONC y Clovis in this struggle, in which, though victor, he did not seek to tu
2 CONC rn the victory to his own advantage, as well as the alliance which he aft
2 CONC erwards concluded with Gondebad, were doubtless due to the influence of C
2 CONC lotilda, who must have viewed the fratricidal struggle with horror. 
2 CONT Clovis died at Paris in 511, and Clotilda had him interred on what was t
2 CONC hen Mons Lucotetius, in the church of the Apostles (later Sainte-Genevièv
2 CONC e), which they had built together to serve as a mausoleum, and which Clot
2 CONC ilda was left to complete. The widowhood of this noble woman was saddene
2 CONC d by cruel trials. Her son Clodomir, son-in-law of Gondebad, made war aga
2 CONC inst his cousin Sigismund, who had succeeded Gondebad on the throne of Bu
2 CONC rgundy, captured him, and put him to death with his wife and children a
2 CONC t Coulmiers, near Orléans. According to the popular epic of the Franks, h
2 CONC e was incited to this war by Clotilda, who thought to avenge upon Sigismu
2 CONC nd the murder of her parents; but, as has already been seen Clotilda ha
2 CONC d nothing to avenge, and, on the contrary, it was probably she who arrang
2 CONC ed the alliance between Clovis and Gondebad. Here the legend is at varian
2 CONC ce with the truth, cruelly defaming the memory of Clotilda, who had the s
2 CONC orrow of seeing Clodomir perish in his unholy war on the Burgundians; h
2 CONC e was vanquished and slain in the battle of Veseruntia (Vezeronce), in 52
2 CONC 4, by Godomar, brother of Sigismund. Clotilda took under her care his thr
2 CONC ee sons of tender age, Theodoald, Gunther, and Clodoald. Childebert and C
2 CONC lotaire, however, who had divided between them the inheritance of their e
2 CONC lder brother, did not wish the children to live, to whom later on they wo
2 CONC uld have to render an account. By means of a ruse they withdrew the child
2 CONC ren from the watchful care of their mother and slew the two eldest, the t
2 CONC hird escaped and entered a cloister, to which he gave his name (Saint-Clo
2 CONC ud, near Paris). 
2 CONT The grief of Clotilda was so great that Paris became insupportable to he
2 CONC r, and she withdrew to Tours where close to the tomb of St. Martin, to wh
2 CONC om she had great devotion, she spent the remainder of her life in praye
2 CONC r and good works. But there were trials still in store for her. Her daugh
2 CONC ter Clotilda, wife of Amalaric, the Visigothic king, being cruelly maltre
2 CONC ated by her husband, appealed for help to her brother Childebert. He wen
2 CONC t to her rescue and defeated Amalaric in a battle, in which the latter wa
2 CONC s killed, Clotilda, however, died on the journey home, exhausted by the h
2 CONC ardships she had endured. Finally, as though to crown the long martyrdo
2 CONC m of Clotilda, her two sole surviving sons, Childebert and Clotaire, bega
2 CONC n to quarrel, and engaged in serious warfare. Clotaire, closely pursued b
2 CONC y Childebert, who had been joined by Theodebert, son of Thierry I, took r
2 CONC efuge in the forest of Brotonne, in Normandy, where he feared that he an
2 CONC d his army would be exterminated by the superior forces of his adversarie
2 CONC s. Then, says Gregory of Tours, Clotilda threw herself on her knees befor
2 CONC e the tomb of St. Martin, and besought him with tears during the whole ni
2 CONC ght not to permit another fratricide to afflict the family of Clovis. Sud
2 CONC denly a frightful tempest arose and dispersed the two armies which were a
2 CONC bout to engage in a hand-to-hand struggle; thus, says the chronicler, di
2 CONC d the saint answer the prayers of the afflicted mother. This was the las
2 CONC t of Clotilda's trials. Rich in virtues and good works, after a widowhoo
2 CONC d of thirty-four years, during which she lived more as a religious than a
2 CONC s a queen, she died and was buried in Paris, in the church of the Apostle
2 CONC s, beside her husband and children. 
2 CONT The life of Saint Clotilda, the principal episodes of which, both legend
2 CONC ary and historic, are found scattered throughout the chronicle of St. Gre
2 CONC gory of Tours was written in the tenth century, by an anonymous author, w
2 CONC ho gathered his facts principally from this source. At an early period sh
2 CONC e was venerated by the Church as a saint, and while popular contemporar
2 CONC y poetry disfigures her noble personality by making her a type of a savag
2 CONC e fury, Clotilda has now entered into the possession of a pure and untarn
2 CONC ished fame, which no legend will be able to obscure.

1 NOTE Bathilde, Bathild or Baldhild, was an English girl who, in 641, was carri
2 CONC ed off by pirates and sold into the household of Erchinoald, mayor of th
2 CONC e palace to Clovis II, King of the Western Franks. Someyears later the ki
2 CONC ng made her his wife, and on the death of thisprofligate young man in 65
2 CONC 7 Bathilde became regent for their eldest son, Chlotar III. In this offic
2 CONC e she opposed the slave-trade, of which she had been both a victim an
2 CONC d a beneficiary, and encouraged monasticism bynumerous benefactions. Abou
2 CONC t 665 her regency came to an end and ambitious nobles unceremoniously rem
2 CONC oved her from court to the nunneryshe had founded at Chelles. Here St. Ba
2 CONC thilde passed the rest of herdays in religious retirement, at the servic
2 CONC e of the nuns and obeyingthe abbess like the least of them.

1 NOTE St. Bathilde: (Or BATILDE).Wife of Clovis II, King of France, time and pl
2 CONC ace of birth unknown; d. January; 680. According to some chronicles she c
2 CONC ame from England and was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon kings, but thi
2 CONC s is a doubtful statement. It is certain that she was a slave in the serv
2 CONC ice of the wife of Erchinoald, mayor of the palace of Neustria. Her unusu
2 CONC al qualities of mind and her virtues inspired the confidence of her maste
2 CONC r who gave many of the affairs of the household into her charge and, afte
2 CONC r the death of his wife, wished to marry her. At this the young girl fle
2 CONC d and did not return until Erchinoald had married again. About this tim
2 CONC e Clovis II met her at the house of the mayor of the palace, and was impr
2 CONC essed by her beauty, grace, and the good report he had of her. He freed a
2 CONC nd married her, 649. This sudden elevation did not diminish the virtues o
2 CONC f Bathilde but gave them a new lustre. Her humility, spirit of prayer, an
2 CONC d large-hearted generosity to the poor were particularly noticeable. Seve
2 CONC n years after their marriage Clovis II died, 656, leaving Bathilde with t
2 CONC hree sons, Clothaire, Childeric, and Thierry. An assembly of the leadin
2 CONC g nobles proclaimed Clothaire III, aged five, king under the regency of h
2 CONC is mother, Bathilde. Aided by the authority and advice of Erchinoald an
2 CONC d the saintly bishops, Eloi (Eligius) of Noyon, Ouen of Rouen, Leéger o
2 CONC f Autun, and Chrodebert of Paris, the queen was able to carry out usefu
2 CONC l reforms. She abolished the disgraceful trade in Christian slaves, and f
2 CONC irmly repressed simony among the clergy. She also led the way in foundin
2 CONC g charitable and religious institutions, such as hospitals and monasterie
2 CONC s. Through her generosity the Abbey of Corbey was founded for men, and th
2 CONC e Abbey of Chelles near Paris for women. At about this date the famous Ab
2 CONC beys of Jumièges, Jouarre, and Luxeuil were established, most probably i
2 CONC n large part through Bathilde's generosity. Berthilde, the first Abbess o
2 CONC f Chelles, who is honoured as a saint, came from Jouarre. The queen wishe
2 CONC d to renounce her position and enter the religious life, but her duties k
2 CONC ept her at court. Erchinoald died in 659 and was succeeded by Ebroin. Not
2 CONC withstanding the ambition of the new mayor of the palace, the queen was a
2 CONC ble to maintain her authority and to use it for the benefit of the kingdo
2 CONC m. After her children were well established in their respective territori
2 CONC es, Childeric IV in Austrasia and Thierry in Burgundy, she returned to he
2 CONC r wish for a secluded life and withdrew to her favourite Abbey of Chelle
2 CONC s near Paris. 
2 CONT On entering the abbey she laid down the insignia of royalty and desire
2 CONC d to be the lowest in rank among the inmates. It was her pleasure to tak
2 CONC e her position after the novices and to serve the poor and infirm with he
2 CONC r own hands. Prayer and manual toil occupied her time, nor did she wish a
2 CONC ny allusion made to the grandeur of her past position. In this manner sh
2 CONC e passed fifteen years of retirement. At the beginning of the year 680 sh
2 CONC e had a presentiment of the approach of death and made religious preparat
2 CONC ion for it. Before her own end, that of Radegonde occurred, a child who
2 CONC m she had held at the baptismal font and had trained in Christian virtue
2 CONC . She was buried in the Abbey of Chelles and was canonized by Pope Nichol
2 CONC as I. The Roman martyrology places her feast on 26 January; in France i
2 CONC t is celebrated 30 January.

1 NOTE DAGOBERT I (d. 639), king of the Franks, was the son of Clotaire II. I
2 CONC n 623 his father established him as king of the region east of the Ardenn
2 CONC es, and in 626 revived for him the ancient kingdom of Austrasia, minus Aq
2 CONC uitaine and Provence. As Dagobert was but yet a child, he was placed unde
2 CONC r the authority of the mayor of the palace, Pepin, and Arnulf, bishop o
2 CONC f Metz. At the death of Clotaire II in 628, Dagobert wished to re-establi
2 CONC sh unity in the Frankish realm, and in 629 and 630 make expeditions int
2 CONC o Neustria and Burgundy, where he succeeded on the whole in securing th
2 CONC e recognition of his authority. In Aquitaine he gave his brother Cariber
2 CONC t the administration of the counties of Toulouse, Cahors, Agen, Perogeu
2 CONC x and Saintes; but at Caribert's death in 632 Dagobert became sole rule
2 CONC r of the whole of the Frankish territories south of the Loire. Under hi
2 CONC m the Merovingian monarchy attained its culminating point. He restored t
2 CONC o the royal domain the lands that had been usurped by the great nobles an
2 CONC d by the church; he maintained at Paris a luxurious, though, from the exa
2 CONC mple he himself set, a disorderly court; he was a patron of the arts an
2 CONC d delighted in the exquisite craftsmanship of his treasurer, the goldsmit
2 CONC h, St. Eloi. His authority was recognized through the length and breadt
2 CONC h of the realm. The duke of the Basques came to his court to swear fideli
2 CONC ty, and at his villa at Clichy the chief of the Bretons of Domnone promis
2 CONC ed obedience. He intervened in the affairs of the Visigoths of Spain an
2 CONC d the Lombards of Italy, and was heard with deference. Indeed, as a sover
2 CONC eign, Dagobert was reckoned superior to the other barbarian kings. He ent
2 CONC ered into relations with the eastern empire, and swore a 'perpetual peace
2 CONC ' with the emperor Heraclius; and it is probable that the two sovereign
2 CONC s took common measures against the Slav and Burgundian tribes which ravag
2 CONC ed in turn the Byzantine state and the German territories subject to th
2 CONC e Franks. Dagobert protected the church and placed illustrious prelates a
2 CONC t the head of the bishoprics---Eloi (Eligius) at Noyon, Ouen (Audoenus) a
2 CONC t Rouen and Didier (Desiderius) at Cahors. His reign is also marked by th
2 CONC e creation of numerous monasteries and by renewed missionary activity i
2 CONC n Flanders and among the Basques. He died on Jan 9, 639, as was buried a
2 CONC t St. Denis. After his death the Frankish monarchy was again divided. I
2 CONC n 634 he had been obliged to give the Austrasians a special king in the p
2 CONC erson of his eldest son Sigebert, and at the birth of a second son, Colvi
2 CONC s, in 635, the Neustrians had immediately claimed him as king. Thus the u
2 CONC nification of the realm, which Dagobert had re-established with so much p
2 CONC ains, was anulled.

2 CONT Dagobert, King of the Franks: 
2 CONT Grant of an Estate to Monks of St. Denis, 635 
2 CONT ------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONC --------
2 CONT A grant of an estate in the seventh century was perhaps the gift of grea
2 CONC test value that could be given by one person to another. No land was gran
2 CONC ted as a rule without the accompanying forms of wealth described by Dagob
2 CONC ert in this charter. Note that serfs and bondsmen were not excluded in ma
2 CONC king the gift. Twenty-seven estates were given at one time by Dagobert t
2 CONC o the Abbey of St. Denis. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Dagobert, King of the Franks, illustrious monarch, to Wandelbert, the Du
2 CONC ke. Whatever we have devoutly granted for the relief of the poor, we beli
2 CONC eve we shall have returned to us with profit in the next life. Therefor
2 CONC e be it known that we have exchanged our villa called Saclas, situated o
2 CONC n the River Juine, in the district of Etampes, and which we have receive
2 CONC d from Lord Ferreol, Bishop of the diocese of Autun, and from Abbot Deoda
2 CONC tus, the clergy and church or basilica of Symphorian, in whose care it i
2 CONC s known to have been, for another villa called Amica, which is in the dis
2 CONC trict of Marseilles, to the increase of our fortune. And that same Sacla
2 CONC s we have devoutly granted in its entirety to the monks of St. Denis, th
2 CONC e martyr, at the monastery where his precious body now rests, being withi
2 CONC n their gates. Therefore we have ordered that from the present date the
2 CONC y shall possess the villa of Saclas, with its houses, serfs, bondsmen, wo
2 CONC ods, meadows, pastures, mills, flocks, shepherds, wholly and entirely, ju
2 CONC st as it was formerly held by the church of Autun and Symphorian until we
2 CONC , as has been said, exchanged it for another. Therefore, because it has b
2 CONC een granted of our bounty, for the salvation of our soul, to the monks o
2 CONC f St. Denis, according to God's will, neither the abbot nor any other per
2 CONC son shall at any time presume to destroy this gift to the monks; but le
2 CONC t it be administered in the name of God by the hand of their abbot in who
2 CONC se assiduous care the monks live. And in whatever way the fisc can augmen
2 CONC t its aid to the poor monks let it do so, so that they and their successo
2 CONC rs may delight in the stability of our kingdom and pray for the salvatio
2 CONC n of our soul. And that this charter may endure for all time we have decr
2 CONC eed that it be signed with our signature. Ursin obtained it. Dagobert gra
2 CONC nted it. 
2 CONT Given on July 28th in the fourteenth year of our reign, at Clichy.

1 NOTE King of the Germans and Emperor of Rome, son of Otto I and Adelaide, b. 9
2 CONC 55; d. in Rome, 7 Dec., 983. In 961 he was elected king at Worms, and wa
2 CONC s crowned at Aix, 26 May. Frail in body, he possessed an intrepid and arb
2 CONC itrary spirit. With him began that extravagant policy of imperialism, whi
2 CONC ch aimed at restoring the world boundaries of the ancients, and to encomp
2 CONC ass the Ancient Sea (the Mediterranean). Germany and Italy were to wiel
2 CONC d the balance of power. Reacting against this imperialistic policy was th
2 CONC e revived strength of particularism. The conflict with the ducal House o
2 CONC f Bavaria gave a dangerous aspect to affairs. In Bavaria (with Otto's app
2 CONC roval) the duchess dowager Judith acted as regent for her son Henry. Upo
2 CONC n coming of age he was given the Duchy of Bavaria in fee by Otto II, who
2 CONC , at the same time, invested Ludolph's son Otto with Swabia on the deat
2 CONC h of Duke Burchard, ignoring the latter's widow, Hedwig, a daughter of Ju
2 CONC dith. Henry, named the "Quarrelsome", supported by Abraham of Friesing, B
2 CONC oleslaw of Bohemia, and Mesislav of Poland, opposed this. The war finall
2 CONC y ended by Judith being immured in a cloister and Henry declared to hav
2 CONC e forfeited his duchy. Ludolph's son Otto received the vacant ducal thron
2 CONC e. The Eastmark was separated from Bavaria and given in fee to Luitpold o
2 CONC f Babenberg, who laid the foundation of the future renown of his family
2 CONC . In 978 Lothair, who aspired to the acquisition of Western Germany, inva
2 CONC ded Lorraine, and pillaged Aix where Otto narrowly escaped capture. But L
2 CONC othair did not advance further. In Dortmund a war of reprisal was at onc
2 CONC e decided upon; with 60,000 men, Otto marched upon Paris, which he faile
2 CONC d to take. Lothair, however, was obliged to come to terms, and in 980 th
2 CONC e two kings met near Sedan, where Otto obtained an agreement securing th
2 CONC e former boundaries. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT In Rome, Crescentius, a son of Theodora, headed a disorderly factional g
2 CONC overnment and sought to settle the affairs of the Holy See by coercion. O
2 CONC tto crossed the Alps and freed the papacy. While in Rome his mind becam
2 CONC e imbued with dreams of ancient imperialism; he would give his imperialis
2 CONC tic policy a firm foundation by bringing all Italy under subjection. In S
2 CONC outhern Italy the Byzantines and Saracens united against the German prete
2 CONC nsions, and in 982 the war with these ancient powers commenced. Tarentu
2 CONC m fell into the hands of the German king, but 15 July, 982, he was defeat
2 CONC ed near Capo Colonne, not far from Cotrone. This battle resulted in the s
2 CONC urrender of Apulia and Calabria and destroyed the prestige of the imperia
2 CONC l authority throughout Italy. The effect spread to the people of the Nort
2 CONC h and the turbulent Slavs on the East, and shortly after the Danes and We
2 CONC nds rose up in arms. But Otto was victorious. The Christian mission, unde
2 CONC r the leadership of pilgrims of Passau, had made great progress in the te
2 CONC rritory of the Magyars. Then came the defeat in Calabria, whereupon all o
2 CONC f Slavonia, particularly the heathen part, revolted against German sovere
2 CONC ignty. The promising beginnings of German and Christian culture east of t
2 CONC he Elbe, inaugurated by Otto, were destroyed. In Bohemia the ecclesiastic
2 CONC al organization was thorougly established, but the emperor was unable t
2 CONC o support the bishop whom he had placed there. On the Havel and the Spre
2 CONC e Christianity was almost annihilated. Affairs were in equally bad condit
2 CONC ion among the Wends. The reign of Otto II has been justly called the peri
2 CONC od of martyrdom for the German Church. The missions which had been organi
2 CONC zed by Otto I were, with few exceptions, destroyed. Otto II now renewed t
2 CONC he despotic policy towards the Saxonian border nobles and incited open di
2 CONC scontent. In 983 he held an Imperial Diet where his son was elected kin
2 CONC g as Otto III and where the assembled nobles pledged their support. He de
2 CONC parted with high hopes for Southern Italy. Fortune seemed to favour the i
2 CONC mperial leaders, who expected to wipe out the disgrace suffered in the so
2 CONC uth. He chose a new pope, Peter of Pavia (John XIV). While in Rome he wa
2 CONC s stricken with malaria and was buried in St. Peter's. At the time of hi
2 CONC s death the relations of the empire towards the papacy were still undefin
2 CONC ed. He had been unable to maintain his political ascendency in Rome. Hi
2 CONC s imperialistic policy had placed the restraints of progressive and pacif
2 CONC ic Christianity and Germanization on the borders; and he, pursuing fancif
2 CONC ul dreams, believed that he might dare to transfer the goal of his polic
2 CONC y to the south.

1 NOTE Probably daughter of Leo Phokas son of Sophia Phokas by her husband Const
2 CONC antin Skleros, brother of Marie (1st wife of the Basileus John Tsimices)
2 CONT  She was about fifteen years old when she arrived in Italy to be marrie
2 CONC d to the sixteen-year-old Otto, heir to the Holy Roman Emperor and alread
2 CONC y King of the Romans. Their marriage had been arranged as part of a peace
2 CONC -treaty between the Eastern and Western Empires. Very little has been rec
2 CONC orded about her, except that she was beautiful and loved by her husband
2 CONC . However, although she apparently did not always get on with her mother-
2 CONC in-law, Theophano became a competent Empress in due course, at times acti
2 CONC ng in his absence as his representative. Yet they did manage to spend mos
2 CONC t of their lives together, indicating that their marriage had become mor
2 CONC e than just pre-arranged. This had taken place in Rome on 14 April 972 an
2 CONC d, according to tradition, she was crowned by Pope John XIII. In the marr
2 CONC iage contract, as a dowry she was given extensive properties in Italy a
2 CONC s well as in The Netherlands. Suddenly, on 7 May 973, her father-in-law d
2 CONC ied and as a result her husband became Emperor Otto II and she his Empres
2 CONC s. In 977 their first child, a daughter, was born followed by another dau
2 CONC ghter almost a year later. In 980 a son and heir, Otto, was born followe
2 CONC d by a third daughter. She accompanied her husband in his unsuccessful ca
2 CONC mpaigns against the Saracens in Southern Italy. Having ignored his health
2 CONC , Otto II died in Theophano's arms on 7 December 983 and was buried in Ro
2 CONC me's St. Peter's Basilica. Many difficult and unhappy years were now to c
2 CONC ome for Theophano, deserted in a time of great need by those people onc
2 CONC e favoured by her husband. Bishop Diederik of Metz, often favoured by Ott
2 CONC o II, became her implacable enemy trying to damage her reputation. This h
2 CONC e continued to do even after she had died. Her son, Emperor Otto III, wa
2 CONC s crowned as King on 25 May 983 in Aachen as a first step to being acknow
2 CONC ledged as Holy Roman Emperor. Bishop Warin of Cologne, custodian of the l
2 CONC ittle boy, gave him to his great-uncle Heinrich, Duke of Bavaria. However
2 CONC , this Heinrich had only just been released from prison, where he had bee
2 CONC n locked up because of his opposition to his brother Emperor Otto I and h
2 CONC is nephew Emperor Otto II. At first Heinrich pretended that he wanted t
2 CONC o act as Regent for the three-year-old Emperor Otto III, but it soon beca
2 CONC me obvious that he wanted to become Emperor himself. Next he took possess
2 CONC ion of Theophano's eldest daughter, Adelheid, and in Quedlinburg was acce
2 CONC pted as King of the Romans by some of Germany's nobles. However, many mor
2 CONC e nobles had sworn to protect the young Emperor and so forced Heinrich t
2 CONC o promise to return the boy to his mother. Before the kidnapping of her s
2 CONC on, Theophano had made arrangements to return to Germany and take upon he
2 CONC r the Regency which was justly hers. Her mother-in-law, Dowager Empress A
2 CONC delaide, remained in Italy as Regent of the Italian kingdom. On 29 June 9
2 CONC 84, Heinrich was forced to appear at a court at Rohr near Meiningen-im-Gr
2 CONC abfeld but refused to hand over the Emperor. In the afternoon of that da
2 CONC y an unusual event took place; apparently a bright star appeared in the s
2 CONC ky and, impressed by such a supernatural phenomenon, he returned both chi
2 CONC ldren to their mother. As a result of the Empress Widow Adelaide having i
2 CONC nterceded for Heinrich, he was left unpunished, though for some time he s
2 CONC till tried to become Emperor. This was until 985 when he was forced to ab
2 CONC andon any claims, while at the same time Theophano had forced his support
2 CONC ers to accept her rule. Neither Heinrich nor his supporters were punishe
2 CONC d when Theophano again refused to take revenge as she, with political ins
2 CONC ight, realised that this would only extend the unrest in the Empire. Whil
2 CONC e her three daughters were brought up in convents, two would remain ther
2 CONC e to become Abbesses. Her son remained at her court where she took grea
2 CONC t care with his education and, as a result, Otto III became one of the be
2 CONC st educated amongst the Holy Roman Emperors. Had he not died at twenty-on
2 CONC e, he would have made a much larger impact on history. As Regent, Theopha
2 CONC no was intelligent and active, thus achieving much more than what other
2 CONC s would have done by the sword. There were border skirmishes with Slav tr
2 CONC ibes as well as with the Frankish kings. She obtained more co-operation f
2 CONC rom the magnates than did her father-in-law, Otto The Great. As regent sh
2 CONC e was required to travel a great deal and, due to her capacity of negotat

1 NOTE The eldest son of Emperor Heinrich the Fowler and Matilda von Ringelheim
2 CONC , his younger years were disturbed by quarrels between his parents. His m
2 CONC other wanted their seven years' younger son, also named Heinrich, acknowl
2 CONC edged as Heinrich the Fowler's heir. However, when Heinrich the Fowler di
2 CONC ed in 936, it was still Otto who, at the age of twenty-four, succeeded. A
2 CONC s in his younger years he preferred to be away from his mother, he did s
2 CONC o by accompanying his father who was subduing the tribes in Bavaria and S
2 CONC uabia. This avoidance of his mother was made even easier when, at the ag
2 CONC e of seventeen, he married Eadgyth, a daughter of the English king, Edwar
2 CONC d the Elder. However, his mother's thoroughly religious education had lef
2 CONC t its mark as not only would he hardly ever miss mass but also founded se
2 CONC veral convents. As well, he considered himself master of the church and n
2 CONC ot it's servant. Otto never learned to read or write, which in later lif
2 CONC e he resented and tried to remedy. He did learn a little French but not e
2 CONC nough to speak it and he had no knowledge of Latin at all. However, he wa
2 CONC s very intelligent and had both a very good memory and judgement of men
2 CONC . He loved hunting and riding wild horses yet was reserved, calm and dign
2 CONC ified. On the other hand he had sudden bursts of temper which he would qu
2 CONC ickly forget, though the people concerned did not. Consequently, he was m
2 CONC ore respected than loved. At his coronation in 936 by Hildebert, Archbish
2 CONC op of Mayence, he made it clear that he intended to be an absolute ruler
2 CONC . To emphasize this he made the Dukes of Bavaria, Suabia, Franconia and L
2 CONC orraine wait upon him at the banquet following the coronation. Some of th
2 CONC ese Dukes resented this and revolted. Amongst the rebels were Otto's half
2 CONC -brother, Thankmar, as well as the resentful younger brother, Heinrich. H
2 CONC einrich was joined by Giselbert, Duke of Lorraine, and marched towards th
2 CONC e Rhine. Although Otto was greatly outnumbered, he was a clever strategis
2 CONC t and so was victorious. Superstition also played a role in his victory a
2 CONC s he carried a "Holy Lance". Further victories were won with this "Holy L
2 CONC ance" so that his brother Heinrich fled to the court of King Louis IV o
2 CONC f France. As Otto wanted peace and not revenge, after a period he sough
2 CONC t the friendship of the defeated dukes. His brother was forgiven, made Du
2 CONC ke of Bavaria, and so became Otto's loyal follower. To pacify the Duke o
2 CONC f Suabia, he arranged the marriage of his son, Liudolf, to Ida, daughte
2 CONC r of Hermann I of Suabia, while the Duke of Lorraine was replaced by Otto
2 CONC 's supporter, Conrad the Red. With peace now within the empire, he wante
2 CONC d to "secure" the borders at the eastern front. His first step was the co
2 CONC nquest of Bohemia and then inflicting devastation on the Slavs living bey
2 CONC ond the Elbe and Oder. While establishing himself in the east, trouble wa
2 CONC s caused by King Louis IV of France who wanted to regain Lorraine. Otto
2 CONC , believing in family ties, was furious with his French brother-in-law an
2 CONC d so marched into France. The defeated Louis IV withdrew into France onl
2 CONC y to be defeated again by Hugues the Great. However, Hugues the Great wa
2 CONC s also a brother-in-law, and, sick of family squabbles, Otto defeated hi
2 CONC m as well. Having secured the western borders, Otto was next invited to i
2 CONC nterfere in Italy. The Italian ruler, Lothar, had died and his position w
2 CONC as taken by the cruel and unscrupulous Berengar II of Ivrea. Berengar tri
2 CONC ed to seize the dowry of Lothar's widow, the beautiful Aelis (or Adelade
2 CONC ). Although she escaped, she was still in danger and so asked for the pro
2 CONC tection of Otto. Coming with an army to Lombardy, he forced Berengar to a
2 CONC cknowledge him as the overlord of Italy, and assumed the title of King o
2 CONC f Italy. Then, as he was a widower, he married Aelis with whom he had fal
2 CONC len in love. Although he hoped to remain in Italy to make sure of its bec
2 CONC oming part of the Empire, he was nevertheless forced to return to German
2 CONC y when his son, Liudolf, revolted out of fear for possible sons Otto migh
2 CONC t father by Aelis. Liudolf was joined by the Archbishop of Mayence and, t
2 CONC o add to the troubles, the Magyars then attacked Bavaria. While reasserti
2 CONC ng his authority in Germany, the Duke of Lorraine, who acted as his repre
2 CONC sentative in Lombardy, joined Berengar against him. In 961 the debauche
2 CONC d pope John XII appealed to Otto to get rid of Berengar, so Otto returne
2 CONC d to Italy and Berengar was forced to acknowledge Otto's supremacy. On 3
2 CONC 1 January 962 in Rome's St. Peter's, Otto was then crowned Holy Roman Emp
2 CONC eror by Pope John XII. Consequently, Otto was now secular master of Europ
2 CONC e as well as head of the church, as he forced Pope John XII to swear alle
2 CONC giance to him. By doing so, the pope became Otto's vassal. When Pope Joh
2 CONC n XII then made it clear that he regretted this action, Otto deposed an
2 CONC d replaced him with Pope Leo VIII. Having settled his affairs in Italy, h
2 CONC e returned to Germany; but in 965 Pope Leo VIII suddenly died and the cle
2 CONC rgy wanted to elect his successor without Otto's consent. Consequently, O
2 CONC tto returned to Italy and appointed the Bishop of Narni as Pope John XIII
2 CONC . However, the Romans then drove John XIII into exile; but in 966, Otto i
2 CONC n turn forced the Romans to accept John XIII. Otto then left Italy for th
2 CONC e last time and his last years saw peace prevail in Europe. He died o
2 CONC n 6 May 973 and was buried in the Cathedral of Magdeburg which he had bui

1 NOTE JOHANNES IIITH VATATZES, emperor of the Byzantine realm of Nikaia Nymphai
2 CONC on 1222-1254, * 1192 (or 1194) as a son of the Basileios Vatatzes and it
2 CONC s wife Angelina in Didymoteichon, + 3.11. 1254 in the garden of the palac
2 CONC e of Nymphaion (today: Nif, KemalpatA). - J. probably 1212, had married t
2 CONC he daughter of the emperor Theodor Ith Laskaris, Irene,: as a son-in-la
2 CONC w of the emperor it could begin the follow-up immediately with its deat
2 CONC h (January 1222). 1224 it erfocht a shining victory over the Lateiner wit
2 CONC h that Poimanen¢n, with which Theodor I. 1204 had schmaehlich lost; but a
2 CONC s the most dangerous opponents not so much the Lateiner proved as rathe
2 CONC r the Greek rulers of Epiros from the sex of the Angeloi. Theodor Angelo
2 CONC s could be proclaimed after the income of Thessalonike 1224 to the empero
2 CONC r, which was obviously against the requirement for rule of J. directed. B
2 CONC ut to 9.3. 1230 were destroying struck Theodor Angelos with Klokotnitza
2 CONC , by the Bulgaren under Ivan IITH Asen: this Bulgarian victory served th
2 CONC e interests of the J in double regard. On the one hand the Angeloi rose n
2 CONC ever more against J.: in the winter 1241 to it Johannes Angelos was subje
2 CONC cted, in December 1246 finally drew in emperors J. with all Pomp and sple
2 CONC ndor in Thessalonike, the rule of the Angeloi over north Greece was there
2 CONC by to end. To second however J. a purpose alliance with the Bulgaren wa
2 CONC s received: Byzantiner and could not Bulgaren besieged 1234 to 1237 toget
2 CONC her those at that time latin capital Konstantinopel, however despite al
2 CONC l efforts the Lateiner out not drive. In the spring 1235 took place the w
2 CONC edding of the emperor son Theodor Laskaris with the Bulgarian Zarentochte
2 CONC r Helena Asen, finally 1237 the final peace between the Greeks and the Bu
2 CONC lgaren was signed. In the meantime however as the most dangerous enemie
2 CONC s of the Byzantine realm of Nikaia Nymphaion the Mongols had emerged: aga
2 CONC inst these J. closed 1243 an alliance with the former ore enemy, with th
2 CONC e Seldschuken of Konya. Since already 1238 it had insured itself to the f
2 CONC riendship of the Stauferkaisers Friedrich II.; after the death of its fir
2 CONC st wife he married 1244 (or already 1242?) however their maid, a Contess
2 CONC a from Italy, as Maetresse, which it had to send back however due to viol
2 CONC ent meeting with hostility relatively soon into their homeland, held itse
2 CONC lf Friedrichs and the Beatrice Lancia blood-young daughter Anna Konstanz
2 CONC e (+ 1313 as a nun in Valencia). - J. operated an extremely intelligent a
2 CONC nd foresighted policy, outward by the mentioned victories and the diploma
2 CONC tic alliances, on the inside by measures of the national education (so fo
2 CONC r instance reestablishment of public libraries), by the creation of larg
2 CONC e grain supplies and particularly by the attachment of the borders of it
2 CONC s realm. He was a ruler, like he only rarely a people granted (B. Sinogow
2 CONC itz); like that it is understandable that it was admired already briefl
2 CONC y after its death as holy.

2 DATE 1054
2 NOTE In the year 1054 twenty-three year old Malcolm returned to Scotland, afte
3 CONC r a period in hiding in England from the ruthless King Macbeth. He had co
3 CONC me back to Scotland to reclaim the throne from Macbeth, who had taken i
3 CONC t from his father, King Duncan, in 1040. 
3 CONT Malcolm and his army defeated Macbeth twice in battle; the second time a
3 CONC t Lumphanan, where Macbeth and his son were both killed, leaving the thro
3 CONC ne for anyone with royal connections to take. Malcolm was crowned king o
3 CONC n 25th April 1058. 
3 CONT King Malcolm III had only been on the throne of Scotland for a short tim
3 CONC e when he sent troops to raid, loot and destroy the villages of Northumbr
3 CONC ia. This act of force was a shock and a blow to England, since King Edwar
3 CONC d the Confessor of England had helped Malcolm gain the Scottish throne i
3 CONC n the first place.
3 CONT Malcolm's aim, and life-long personal ambition, was to conquer norther
3 CONC n England. His strikes were initially successful and many innocent peopl
3 CONC e lost their money and their homes. In spite of the attacks, however, Eng
3 CONC land retained control in the north. 
3 CONT The Coming of the Normans.
3 CONT Only seven years later further events in the north caused the downfall o
3 CONC f the English King. Harold Hardrada, King of Norway attempted to take ove
3 CONC r Northumbria and Malcolm decided to help the Norwegians. This was partl
3 CONC y because his (first) wife was related to Harold Hardrada, and partly bec
3 CONC ause he wanted a share of Northumbria.
3 CONT  Edward the Confessor had died at the end of 1065 and Harold Godwinson h
3 CONC ad taken the throne, to the fury of William, Duke of Normandy, who had un
3 CONC derstood from his kinsman, Edward, that he would succeed him. In fact, wh
3 CONC en Harold Godwinson had been blown off course during a storm in the Engli
3 CONC sh Channel in 1064 William had made Harold promise to support Williams c
3 CONC laim to the throne as the price for his freedom. 
3 CONT When the King of England heard about the Norse invasion, he marched hi
3 CONC s army northwards. The English defeated the Norwegians, but were forced t
3 CONC o return to the south immediately because an invasion force led by Duke W
3 CONC illiam had landed.
3 CONT Harold met William at Hastings where in a great battle the King of Engla
3 CONC nd was fatally wounded. According to the Bayeux Tapestry, Harold was kill
3 CONC ed either by an arrow piercing his eye or by the sword of a Norman knight
3 CONC . William marched to Westminster Abbey where he crowned himself King of E
3 CONC ngland.
3 CONT This event is known as the Norman Conquest; it changed the course of Bri
3 CONC tish history. Many Saxons fled north to Scotland after the arrival of th
3 CONC e Normans. Among these were Edgar Atheling, last of King Alfreds line, a
3 CONC nd his sister Margaret. 
3 CONT In 1070 Malcolm married Margaret, Edgar's sister, in Dunfermline and i
3 CONC n the same year he invaded England. This was partly so that he could hel
3 CONC p his brother-in-law, Edgar Atheling gain control of the English throne
3 CONC , but mainly because he wanted to extend his Kingdom. Through Margaret, h
3 CONC is second wife, he had a slight, but positive claim to the throne of Engl
3 CONC and. (This was because Edgar and Margaret were the grandchildren of Kin
3 CONC g Edmund Ironside of England.)
3 CONT This meant that Malcolm could try to become the King of both Scotland an
3 CONC d England. When William discovered Malcolm's link to royalty, he knew h
3 CONC e must crush any such ideas of Malcolms. William marched an army up to S
3 CONC cotland in 1072 and met the king of Scotland at Stirling. Edgar Athelin
3 CONC g abandoned Canmore and fled to Flanders in Belgium. When Malcolm saw th
3 CONC e size of William's army, he promised that he would not hurt, or encroac
3 CONC h on, the English or their kingdom. He also made the decision to pay homa
3 CONC ge to the Monarch of England. This decision was to have fateful consequen
3 CONC ces for the independence of Scotland in later, even more dangerous times
3 CONC . 
3 CONT For about seven years, Malcolm kept to his promise. For no known reaso
3 CONC n though, in 1079 he once more invaded the north of England. He viciousl
3 CONC y attacked Northumberland in Scottish style, which meant that Northumberl
3 CONC and was savagely torn apart. In the following year the Normans again atta
3 CONC cked Scotland. They decided to build a castle over the river Tyne for mor
3 CONC e protection, and to stand watch against further Scottish attacks. Malcol
3 CONC m was then, of course reminded of his peace agreement, and pledged to kee
3 CONC p it for another twelve years.
3 CONT Queen Margaret (St. Margaret)
3 CONT Whilst all of this was taking place, Malcolm's wife Margaret put all o
3 CONC f her time and effort as wife and Queen of Scotland into religion and int
3 CONC o creating a more civilised court in Scotland. Intelligent and very relig
3 CONC ious, she was determined to modernise Scotland by introducing ideas fro
3 CONC m England and Europe.
3 CONT 1. She brought softness to the harsh kingdom of the north by copying som
3 CONC e of the ways of the Normans. She introduced spiced meats and French wine
3 CONC s; lovely tapestries and rich clothes; dancing and singing of ballads.  
3 CONT 2. She taught the priests to live simply and without wealth, giving thei
3 CONC r whole lives to Christian belief.  
3 CONT 3. She made Sunday into a day of worship.  
3 CONT 4. Around the time of 1070 she invited three English Benedictine monks f
3 CONC rom Canterbury to build a monastery at Dunfermline. This was the start o
3 CONC f monasteries in Scotland. The monks brought with them new skills in farm
3 CONC ing and building.  
3 CONT 5. She built a new chapel in Edinburgh Castle, in Norman style. It is th
3 CONC e oldest standing church in Scotland today. St. Margaret spent many hour
3 CONC s there in prayer.  
3 CONT 6. She gave large sums of money and land to the Church to help the poor 
3 CONT 7. Margaret also launched the Queen's Ferry over the Firth of Forth to S
3 CONC t. Andrews.  
3 CONT Her life of charity and kindness impressed the rough and ambitious Kin
3 CONC g Malcolm so much that he supported his wife's good works. He allowed hi
3 CONC s wealth to be donated to charity and on one occasion he fed three hundre
3 CONC d needy subjects in his royal hall. 
3 CONT Before the twelve-year peace agreement that he had made with the Norman
3 CONC s had expired Malcolm Canmore launched another invasion of northern Engla
3 CONC nd, in 1091. He chose a time when William the Conqueror's son William Ruf
3 CONC us, who had by this time succeeded his father, was not in Britain, but No
3 CONC rmandy.
3 CONT Edgar Atheling returned from Belgium to take part in the invasion. Eve
3 CONC n although Malcolm Canmore had pledged to help Atheling regain the Englis
3 CONC h throne, he was much more interested in putting his own family on the th
3 CONC rone. However, the English repulsed the Scottish invasion and for the thi
3 CONC rd time Malcolm made a peace agreement. The English built a castle at Car
3 CONC lisle to patrol the border. 
3 CONT You would have thought that the invasion attempts would have stopped the
3 CONC n, but they didn't as in 1093 Canmore once more attacked England. But h
3 CONC e was killed during the raid and his son died also from wounds received
3 CONC . When the news reached poor Margaret she was already very sick with a te
3 CONC rminal illness; she died four days later. 
3 CONT Malcolm's life as a King was nothing more than a reckless baron robber
3 CONC . He never did help his brother-in-law succeed to the English throne. I
3 CONC n fact he didn't even have any success for himself. Again and again he wo
3 CONC uld try to invade England, but he never really achieved anything. The exc
3 CONC use Canmore gave for continually invading England was to advance his brot
3 CONC her in laws claim. But in-fact Canmore was nothing more than a greedy, v
3 CONC icious tyrant. He cared about nothing apart from doing things for his ow
3 CONC n gain.
3 CONT They were such an unlikely couple; Margaret was loving and caring, she w
3 CONC as often called Saint Margaret. He was dangerous and duplicitous, nothin
3 CONC g like his gentle wife. No matter how much Margaret tried to convert he
3 CONC r husband from his wrong doings, she never succeeded. Margaret led a succ
3 CONC essful life in the church, while Malcolm tried, brutally, to gain contro
3 CONC l and power over his brother-in-law's homeland. Margaret was interested i
3 CONC n helping others and she did a lot of work in the church. Malcolm on th
3 CONC e other hand, was greedy and a tyrant. Two separate lives, in two separat
3 CONC e worlds, brought together by fate.

1 NOTE St. Margaret of Scotland
2 CONT Born about 1045, died 16 Nov., 1092, was a daughter of Edward "Outremere
2 CONC ", or "the Exile", by Agatha, kinswoman of Gisela, the wife of St. Stephe
2 CONC n of Hungary. She was the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside. A constant tr
2 CONC adition asserts that Margaret's father and his brother Edmund were sent t
2 CONC o Hungary for safety during the reign of Canute, but no record of the fac
2 CONC t has been found in that country. The date of Margaret's birth cannot b
2 CONC e ascertained with accuracy, but it must have been between the years 1038
2 CONC , when St. Stephen died, and 1057, when her father returned to England. I
2 CONC t appears that Margaret came with him on that occasion and, on his deat
2 CONC h and the conquest of England by the Normans, her mother Agatha decided t
2 CONC o return to the Continent. A storm however drove their ship to Scotland
2 CONC , where Malcolm III received the party under his protection, subsequentl
2 CONC y taking Margaret to wife. This event had been delayed for a while by Mar
2 CONC garet's desire to entire religion, but it took place some time between 10
2 CONC 67 and 1070. 
2 CONT In her position as queen, all Margaret's great influence was thrown int
2 CONC o the cause of religion and piety. A synod was held, and among the specia
2 CONC l reforms instituted the most important were the regulation of the Lente
2 CONC n fast, observance of the Easter communion, and the removal of certain ab
2 CONC uses concerning marriage within the prohibited degrees. Her private lif
2 CONC e was given up to constant prayer and practices of piety. She founded sev
2 CONC eral churches, including the Abbey of Dunfermline, built to enshrine he
2 CONC r greatest treasure, a relic of the true Cross. Her book of the Gospels
2 CONC , richly adorned with jewels, which one day dropped into a river and wa
2 CONC s according to legend miraculously recovered, is now in the Bodleian libr
2 CONC ary at Oxford. She foretold the day of her death, which took place at Edi
2 CONC nburgh on 16 Nov., 1093, her body being buried before the high altar at D
2 CONC unfermline. 
2 CONT In 1250 Margaret was canonized by Innocent IV, and her relics were trans
2 CONC lated on 19 June, 1259, to a new shrine, the base of which is still visib
2 CONC le beyond the modern east wall of the restored church. At the Reformatio
2 CONC n her head passed into the possession of Mary Queen of Scots, and later w
2 CONC as secured by the Jesuits at Douai, where it is believed to have perishe
2 CONC d during the French Revolution. According to George Conn, "De duplici sta
2 CONC tu religionis apud Scots" (Rome, 1628), the rest of the relics, togethe
2 CONC r with those of Malcolm, were acquired by Philip II of Spain, and place
2 CONC d in two urns in the Escorial. When, however, Bishop Gillies of Edinburg
2 CONC h applied through Pius IX for their restoration to Scotland, they could n
2 CONC ot be found. 
2 CONT The chief authority for Margaret's life is the contemporary biography pr
2 CONC inted in "Acta SS.", II, June, 320. Its authorship has been ascribed to T
2 CONC urgot, the saint's confessor, a monk of Durham and later Archbishop of St
2 CONC . Andrews, and also to Theodoric, a somewhat obscure monk; but in spite o
2 CONC f much controversy the point remains quite unsettled. The feast of St. Ma
2 CONC rgaret is now observed by the whole Church on 10 June.

2 CONC : 'No one remarried as swiftly as Isabel de Vermandois.At most a few day
2 CONC s after the death of her first husband Robert deBeaumont, count of Meula
2 CONC n and later earl of Leicester, Isabel wedWilliam II de Warenne, earl of S

1 NOTE Princess of England
2 CONT Died in childbirth
2 CONT 
2 CONT [William de Warenne] was married to Gundrada, who was once thought to ha
2 CONC ve been a daughter of William the Conqueror. Some authorities are now inc
2 CONC lined to think that Gundrada was the Conqueror's stepdaughter, whose moth
2 CONC er, Queen Matilda, had been previously married to a nobleman of Flanders
2 CONC . Gundrada's name is spelt in various ways, sometimes without the last 'a
2 CONC ', which is the Latin form; occasionally in contemporary documents it i
2 CONC s given as Gundred. Both her name and her husband's have survived in Lewe
2 CONC s as the names for modern roads....
2 CONT 
2 CONT Cobb, pp. 33-34:
2 CONT [The Norman women began arriving in England to keep their husbands compa
2 CONC ny.] At last it was decided that Queen Matilda should set an example fo
2 CONC r the others, and she was certainly in England at the time of her husband
2 CONC 's coronation in Westminster Abbey. Then Gundrada, the wife of William d
2 CONC e Warenne, came over to settle in Sussex with him. The exact date is no
2 CONC t known. Probably it was not until the castle at Lewes was fit for habita
2 CONC tion, and fit for the arrival of Gundrada and her ladies, and also when t
2 CONC he countryside had settled down under the new administration....
2 CONT Gundrada would have been only about sixteen when she arrived in Sussex (
2 CONC high-born Norman ladies married young), for she was only thirty-five whe
2 CONC n she died in 1085. She had five children, two sons and three daughters
2 CONC . Perhaps the eldest, William, who was to succeed his father as Earl of S
2 CONC urrey, was already born when she came to England. It is probable that Wil
2 CONC liam de Warenne was considerably older than his wife, for he had fought f
2 CONC or Duke William and was high in favour some years before the conquest o
2 CONC f these shores.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Cobb, p. 38: [The windows of Lewes Castle] would not have been the glass
2 CONC -filled windows as we know them today, but narrow slits in enormously thi
2 CONC ck walls. To keep out the wind and the rain, skins were hung across them
2 CONC . In the rooms prepared for the lady of the castle, the windows would hav
2 CONC e been slightly larger than those in the guardroom below, occupied by th
2 CONC e soldiery, and more within range of hostile arrows and other missiles.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Cobb, p. 43: [The monastery at Cluny in France] was one of the most famo
2 CONC us of the [Benedictine] houses, and ... probably in 1076 ... two unexpect
2 CONC ed and distinguished visitors arrived there. They were William and Gundra
2 CONC da de Warenne. They had made the long journey through France and across t
2 CONC he sea from the coast of Sussex ... and their visit was to have a far-rea
2 CONC ching effect upon the place that had become their home.
2 CONT William de Warenne must have worked hard and long in organizing the land
2 CONC s under his control, but at the end of ten years he appears to have consi
2 CONC dered that his house was in order and that he could safely leave it fo
2 CONC r a while. He may have made short visits to Normandy during the interveni
2 CONC ng years, but now he intended to be away for a much longer period....So [
2 CONC he] decided to set out on a pilgrimage to Rome, and to take Gundrada wit
2 CONC h him....They had decided to make the pilgrimage to Rome and for safety'
2 CONC s sake the pilgrims travelled in companies, and without money. They staye
2 CONC d overnight at monasteries along the route. By the time that this journe
2 CONC y lwas planned Gundrada must have seen something of England besides Susse
2 CONC x, for it is known that she visited Reigate in Surrey, and Castle Acre i
2 CONC n Norfolk, where William de Warenne had also built castles
2 CONT The castle at Reigate was built of stone, but it can never have been a
2 CONC s big as Lewes Castle....Only the entrance and some smaller parts of it
2 CONC s fortifications still stand. Very little remains of the castle at Castl
2 CONC e Acre, but it was evidently of considerable size, standing on a huge ear
2 CONC thwork....There is little doubt that Gundrada was often in Norfolk and sh
2 CONC e was to die at Castle Acre when her fifth child was born....
2 CONT William and Gundrada were never to reach Rome. When they came to Burgund
2 CONC y they discovered that war was raging between the German King and the Pop
2 CONC e, and that it would be dangerous for them to proceed. So they turned asi
2 CONC de to visit the monastery of Cluny...and were much impressed...by...the l
2 CONC earning, piety, charity, and discipline of the monks. 'We found the chari
2 CONC ty so great there . . . we began to have love and devotion to that Order
2 CONC , and to that house above all other houses that we have seen.'
2 CONT William de Warenne had already entertained the desire to found a monasti
2 CONC c house near Lewes, but he now decided that it would be a good thing if i
2 CONC t were attached to the monastery at Cluny....So while still at Cluny, Wil
2 CONC liam sent a letter to the Abbot [Hugh] asking him if he would be willin
2 CONC g to send a small band of monks to England to start a foundation of Bened
2 CONC ictines [there]. [At first Hugh refused because of the distance and becau
2 CONC se England was a foreign land; also he and Willam the Conqueror were no
2 CONC t on good terms. William de Warenne grew impatient and began looking fo
2 CONC r another abbot. Perhaps Hugh heard of this, for he changed his mind an
2 CONC d sent three or four monks to England.] The original Charter for the ne
2 CONC w Priory that was sent to Clulny by William de Warenne still exists i
2 CONC n a museum in Paris [bearing the signatures of King William, Queen Matild
2 CONC a, and William de Warenne]. This document shows that Gundrada was not abl
2 CONC e to write herself, for against her name, in the writing of a scribe, sh
2 CONC e has made a cross, her mark....[probably Gundrada was highly educated t
2 CONC o the standard for women of her day, but illiteracy was common. Probabl
2 CONC y she spoke only French all her life, for she was hardly likely to have h
2 CONC ad much direct contact with the Saxons of Sussex.]
2 CONT The Charter says that the foundation was to be 'endowed for the health a
2 CONC nd souls of William de Warenne and his wife', but further in the deed Wil
2 CONC liam de Warenne seems to have thought it necessary to qualify this gift b
2 CONC y pronouncing a special curse! It runs thus:
2 CONT 'May God meet those who oppose and destroy these with the sword of anger
2 CONC , fury, and vengeance, and eternal malediction; but may God meet those wh
2 CONC o preserve and defend them, in peace, grace, and mercy, and eternal salva
2 CONC tion. Amen, Amen, Amen.'
2 CONT [Charter also mentions gifts to be given for the foundation, including '
2 CONC six ploughs and serfs' and other land in the district. More ploughs and s
2 CONC erfs were to be given by Gundrada. A gift of moneyh, fifty English 'soldi
2 CONC ', was to be paid to the monastery at Cluny, otherwise the Priory to be f
2 CONC ounded at Lewes would not come under the jurisdiction of the parent monas
2 CONC tery.] Gundrada also seems to have possessed land at Falmer, four miles f
2 CONC rom Lewes, a gift from her mother; and this later was to be given to th
2 CONC e Priory, which in the years to come was to receive many bequests of lan
2 CONC d and other gifts that added to its wealth. In due time, three monks fro
2 CONC m Cluny ... arrived in Sussex under the charge of one Don Lanzo, who ha
2 CONC d been appointed the first Prior at Southover. [Right up to the last mome
2 CONC nt, Abbot Hugh had delayed his departure.]....
2 CONT The walls of the Priory at Southover enclosed thirty acres, and within t
2 CONC hem were a magnificent church, 420 feet long (bigger than Chichester Cath
2 CONC edral), and a fine Chapter House. It was there at their own request tha
2 CONC t William and Gundrada were buried. They did not live long enough to se
2 CONC e the dedication and consecration of the church, whose progress they ha
2 CONC d watched....William de Warenne was killed at the siege of Pevensey Castl
2 CONC e, three years after his wife had died. In a charter he desires to lie wh
2 CONC ere 'his wife lies'.
2 CONT Three annivesaries were kept each year at the Priory, in honour of the f
2 CONC ounders, when special alms were given to the poor. At the Hospital of St
2 CONC . James opposite the entrance of the Priory, there lived thirteen poor br
2 CONC ethren and sisters, who received an endowment of 16 pounds, 10 shillings
2 CONC , and who had to pray for the souls of the founder and his heirs....
2 CONT Little is known of William de Warenne's characteristics, save his prowes
2 CONC s in arms and powers of administration. But the inscription on Gundrada'
2 CONC s tomb shows that she was very devout and, according to one translation,
2 CONT Through England's Church diffused the purest grace,
2 CONT As Mary pious and as Martha kind,
2 CONT In her were faith and charity combined.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Cobb, pp. 63-64: On the morning of October 28th, 1845, some workmen [dig
2 CONC ging through the priory to build a railroad line] came upon something har
2 CONC d...They brought to the surface from under two slabs of Caen stone two sm
2 CONC all cists, or chests. The larger measured [2' 11"] long, and [12 1/2"] br
2 CONC oad; the other was two inches shorter. The lids of the cists [were made o
2 CONC f lead, ornamented with a simple crossed design, and at the head of eac
2 CONC h a name could be seen: on the larger, WILLELM, and on the other, GUNDRAD
2 CONC A. They contained the bones of a man and a woman.] It was a great discove
2 CONC ry which had been made on the site of the Chapter House of the Priory o
2 CONC f St. Pancras, which had been destroyed at the dissolution of the Monaste
2 CONC ries. As it was known that [the couple] had been buried before the altar
2 CONC , there seemed little doubt as to whose remains they were. Some authoriti
2 CONC es [believe that] the bodies may have been reburied when the Priory was e
2 CONC nlarged in the [12th] century, and the Chapter House was built. The lette
2 CONC ring on the cists seems to belong to that period. People of [importance a
2 CONC t the time] were buried in full-length stone coffins. William and Gundrad
2 CONC a probably lay at first before the high altar of the Priory church. [Th
2 CONC e digging revealed other remains, probably of monks, early Priors, and ch
2 CONC ildren, possibly those of the family of the De Warennes and of various la
2 CONC ymen. Also found were bones alongside weapons, probably the remains of th
2 CONC e dead from the battle of Lewes in 1264. The monks that day had tended th
2 CONC e wounded and buried the dead from both sides on the site.]
2 CONT By a strange coincidence, some little time after the discovery of the tw
2 CONC o cists, a marble slab, evidently belonging to the original tomb of Gundr
2 CONC ada was discovered in the church at the village of Isfield, a few miles a
2 CONC way in the Weald. It had become part of a tomb that had been put up to th
2 CONC e memory of a cofferer, a kind of steward, in the employment of Henry VII
2 CONC I. No one seems to have bothered to understand the Latin inscription whic
2 CONC h is included in the design that borders, and goes down the centre of th
2 CONC e beautifully cut black marble. It records Gundrada's name and her many v
2 CONC irtues, and that she died in childbirth on 'the sixth kalend of June'.
2 CONT There may have once been a similar tomb for William de Warenne, who ha
2 CONC d desired to be buried beside his wife. Now once again their remains res
2 CONC t together beneath the slab cut in memory of Gundrada, in a small memoria
2 CONC l chapel which has been built to contain them in Southover Church, not fa
2 CONC r from the few surviving portions of the great Priory.

1 NOTE Earl of Surrey
2 CONT Lewes Castle was built by William de Warenne at the end of the elevent
2 CONC h century. After the Norman invasion in 1066 William de Warenne was give
2 CONC n land in Sussex, Surrey, and Norfolk. He built three castles but his chi
2 CONC ef residence was at Lewes. Lewes Castle was built by William de Warenne s
2 CONC oon after the Norman invasion. Most experts say it was originally made o
2 CONC f wood but others insist it was flint. It was probably in the early 12t
2 CONC h century that a sturdy stone castle was erected.
2 CONT Some sources say he died at Pevensey.
2 CONT Ruth Cobb, "'Travellers to the Town," London: The Epworth Press, 1953, p
2 CONC p. 25-26:
2 CONT The commander of this part of Sussex [around Lewes] appointed by Willia
2 CONC m the Conqueror was one William de Warenne, who had long been high in th
2 CONC e Conqueror's favour, having distinguished himself as a warrior in France
2 CONC . A contemporary account says
2 CONT William de Warenne his own squadron led,
2 CONT And well sat the helmet on so knightly a head.
2 CONT ....The land over which William de Warenne was given control consisted o
2 CONC f the Burgh and the entire Rape of Lewes--about a sixteenth of Sussex. H
2 CONC e was also given the land at Castle Acre in Norfolk and at Reigate in Sur
2 CONC rey. Later he was to be created Earl of Surrey as a reward for help tha
2 CONC t he had given in quelling an insurrection of some rebellious barons.
2 CONT [on p. 30 Cobb refers to him as "dark-haired".]
2 CONT p. 31: Although it is now a ruin, the castle built by William de Warenn
2 CONC e in the centre [of Lewes]--and from where his descendants were to rule u
2 CONC ntil the end of the [14th] century--still seems to dominate the place. Th
2 CONC e entrance is off the High Street where, in medieval days, a Market Cros
2 CONC s once stood. Where there was once a drawbridge, there is now a permanen
2 CONC t causeway, and the name 'Castle Ditch' is still in use for the piece o
2 CONC f moat that protected it on one side. It is now a narrow thoroughfare.
2 CONT The entrance arch built by William de Warenne still stands, but in fron
2 CONC t of it is a magnificent Barbican, one of the finest in England, built i
2 CONC n the [14th] century by a later de Warenne. To the left, on its high moun
2 CONC d, stands about half of the old keep with two of the towers that were add
2 CONC ed, still intact, and with windows of a much later date. From the keep, t
2 CONC here is a magnificent view down the valley over which the sea once flowe
2 CONC d when the castle guarded a port, as well as the heights of the downs o
2 CONC n either side.
2 CONT See notes on his wife Gundrada for Cobb's commentary on his and Gundrada
2 CONC 's founding of the Priory at Southover after visiting the monastery at Cl
2 CONC uny.
2 CONT Cobb, p. 54: In the time of William de Warenne, the Priory at Southover
2 CONC , which he had built, must have needed large supplies of food--not only f
2 CONC or the members of the community, but also for the many travellers who sta
2 CONC yed in the guest house. The low-lying land nearby was not suitable for th
2 CONC e growing of corn; a grange or farm elsewhere was a necessity, so one wa
2 CONC s built on the land that William de Warenne had given to the Priory at Sw
2 CONC anborough. The charter says that 'he gave to God and the Abbot of Cluny
2 CONC , five hides and a half of land, and also free fishing in the waters'. Th
2 CONC is must have been in 1080, for by then the building of the grange had bee
2 CONC n completed. It is possible that some of the great beams in the barn whic
2 CONC h are still to be seen at the present farm at Swanborough, may have bee
2 CONC n put up by the monks who worked there so long ago.

1 NOTE Ancient Lineage of Magna Carta Baron: William de Warenne
2 CONT William the Conqueror was a third or fourth generation Viking whose ance
2 CONC stor was reportedly from Honefoss in what is now Norway, near the Oslofjo
2 CONC rd. The de Vermandois connection relates to one of the small post-Carolin
2 CONC gian Frankish kingdoms along the northern border of present-day France
2 CONC .  Princesses from the Frankish kingdom married de Warennes on at least t
2 CONC wo occasions. Perhaps this was done to placate the fierce Vikings and t
2 CONC o enlist their help for defensive purposes. This strategy was used by th
2 CONC e King of France who arranged similar marriages for his daughters in 91
2 CONC 1 when he recognized the Duchy of Normandy under Rollo aka Rolf or Hrolf
2 CONC , an altogether evil king. [1]
2 CONT The House of Warren can be traced to Hugh of Normandy, born 990, later o
2 CONC rdained Bishop of Contances. He married a sister of Gunnora, the wife o
2 CONC f Richard I, Duke of Normandy. Rodulf, son to Hugh, a benefactor to the A
2 CONC bbey of La Trinite du Mont, died c1050. He married first Beatrix and seco
2 CONC ndly Emma. Emma became the mother of his son William created Count de War
2 CONC enne of Normandy and later first Earl of Surrey. [2]
2 CONT William de Warenne, son of Rodulf, was born in Normandy and accompanie
2 CONC d William the Conqueror to England in 1066. At the Battle of Hastings, h
2 CONC e commanded a detachment and was rewarded with estates and manors in Norf
2 CONC olk becoming the first Earl of Surrey. Before 1070, William de Warenne ma
2 CONC rried Gundred, a lady with disputed parentage since many scholars disbeli
2 CONC eve she was the daughter of the Conqueror.  Some contend she was the Duke
2 CONC 's daughter as proven by her tombstone at St. John's Church, Southover, L
2 CONC ewes: "Within this Pew stands the tombstone of Gundrad, daughter of Willi
2 CONC am the Conqueror, and wife of  William, the First Earl of Warren, which h
2 CONC aving been deposited over her remains in the Chapter-House of Lewes Prior
2 CONC y and lately discovered in Iffield Church, was removed to this place at t
2 CONC he expense of William Burrell Esq. in 1775 A.D. [3]
2 CONT Gundred died in childbirth at Castle Acre May 27, 1085, and was buried i
2 CONC n the Priory of Lewes in County Sussex. Four of her children matured: Wil
2 CONC liam Son & Heir, Reginald, Gundred, and Edith. William, now Earl of Surre
2 CONC y, rebuilt, enlarged, and strengthened Lewes Castle which is now used a
2 CONC s the museum of Sussex Archaeological Society. William de Warenne founde
2 CONC d Cluniac Priory in 1078, now a ruin, and endowed the chapter house of th
2 CONC e Priory. He married secondly a daughter of William, sister of Richard Gu
2 CONC et of Montmirail, and died June 24, 1088, from wounds received at the sie
2 CONC ge of Pevensey. He is buried near Ely Cathedral in East Anglia. [4]

2 CONC ther encouraged their learning by showing Alfred and his brothers a beaut
2 CONC ifully illuminated book of poetry saying the one who could read it firs
2 CONC t could have it. Alfred, the youngest, was first. As a young man he was h
2 CONC is brother King Ethelred's supporter in the struggle against the maraudin
2 CONC g Vikings. In 868 he married Ealhswith by whom he had a large family. Whe
2 CONC n in 871 he succeeded his brother Ethelwulf as king, most of England wa
2 CONC s in Danish hands. Even though they won several small victories and, in 8
2 CONC 75, a seabattle, the Danes had the upper hand. Alfred had to take refug
2 CONC e in 877 and, during this period of not being seen, stories emerged of hi
2 CONC s being disguised as a wandering minstrel and strolling into Danish camp
2 CONC s to gather information. There was also the story of his burning the cake
2 CONC s he had been asked to watch. In May 878, joined by English forces, he dr
2 CONC ove back the Danes to Chippenham. This was the turning point from which A
2 CONC lfred again emerged as King of England. Twice a year he called a great co
2 CONC uncil which was the beginning of the English Parliament. Apparently Alfre
2 CONC d suffered from a strange, regularly re-occurring illness as recorded b
2 CONC y Asser, Bishop of Sherborne. According to Sir Iain Moncreiffe of That Il
2 CONC k, it might have been porphyria. Alfred died 26 October 899 and was burie
2 CONC d at Winchester. His wife survived till 5 December 902.

1 NOTE Clovis (CHLODWIG, or CHLODOWECH) Son of Childeric, King of the Salic Fra
2 CONC nks; born in the year 466; died at Paris, 27 November, 511. He succeede
2 CONC d his father as the King of the Franks of Tournai in 481. His kingdom wa
2 CONC s probably one of the States that sprang from the division of Clodion's m
2 CONC onarchy like those of Cambrai, Tongres and Cologne. Although a Pagan, Chi
2 CONC lderic had kept up friendly relations with the bishops of Gaul, and whe
2 CONC n Clovis ascended the throne he received a most cordial letter of congrat
2 CONC ulation from St. Remigius, Archbishop of Reims. The young king early bega
2 CONC n his course of conquest by attacking Syagrius, son of Aegidius, the Roma
2 CONC n Count. Having established himself at Soissons, he acquired sovereign au
2 CONC thority over so great a part of Northern Gaul as to be known to his conte
2 CONC mporaries as the King of Soissons. Syagrius, being defeated, fled for pro
2 CONC tection to Alaric II, King of the Visigoths, but the latter, alarmed b
2 CONC y a summons from Clovis, delivered Syagrius to his conqueror, who had hi
2 CONC m decapitated in 486. Clovis then remained master of the dominions of Sya
2 CONC grius and took up his residence at Soissons. It would seem as if the epis
2 CONC ode of the celebrated vase of Soissons were an incident of the campaign a
2 CONC gainst Syagrius, and it proves that, although a pagan, Clovis continued h
2 CONC is father's policy by remaining on amicable terms with Gaulish episcopate
2 CONC . The vase, taken by the Frankish soldiers while plundering a church, for
2 CONC med part of the booty that was to be divided among the army. It was claim
2 CONC ed by the bishop (St. Remigius?), and the king sought to have it awarde
2 CONC d to himself in order to return it intact to the bishop, but a dissatisfi
2 CONC ed soldier split the vase with his battle-axe, saying to this king: 'Yo
2 CONC u will get only the share allotted you by fate'. Clovis did not openly re
2 CONC sent the insult, but the following year, when reviewing his army he cam
2 CONC e upon this same soldier and, reproving him for the the defective conditi
2 CONC on of his arms, he split his skull with an axe, saying: 'It was thus tha
2 CONC t you treated the Soissons vase.' This incident has often been cited to s
2 CONC how that although in time of war a king has unlimited authority over hi
2 CONC s army, after the war his power is restricted and that in the division o
2 CONC f booty the rights of the soldiers must be respected. After the defeat o
2 CONC f Syagrius, Clovis extended his dominion as far as the Loire. It was owin
2 CONC g to the assistance given him by the Gaulish episcopate that he gained po
2 CONC ssession of the country. The bishops, it is quite certain mapped out th
2 CONC e regime that afterwards prevailed. Unlike that adopted in other barbaria
2 CONC n kingdoms founded upon the ruins of the Roman Empire, this regime establ
2 CONC ished absolute equality between the Gallo-Roman natives and their Germani
2 CONC c conquerors all sharing the same privileges. Procopius, a Byzantine writ
2 CONC er has given us an idea of this agreement, but we know it best by its res
2 CONC ults. There was no distribution of Gaulish territory by the victors; esta
2 CONC blished in the Belgian provinces, they had lands there to which they retu
2 CONC rned after each campaign. All the free men in the kingdom of Clovis, whet
2 CONC her they were of Roman or of Germanic origin, called themselves Franks, a
2 CONC nd we must guard against the old mistake of looking upon the Franks afte
2 CONC r Clovis as no more than Germanic barbarians. Master of half of Gaul, Clo
2 CONC vis returned to Belgium and conquered the two Salic kingdoms of Cambrai a
2 CONC nd Tongres (?), where his cousins Ragnacaire and Chararic reigned. Thes
2 CONC e events have been made known to us only through the poetic tradition o
2 CONC f the Franks which has singularly distorted them. According to this tradi
2 CONC tion Clovis called upon Chararic to assist him its his war against Syagri
2 CONC us, but Chararic's attitude throughout the battle was most suspicious, a
2 CONC s he refrained from taking sides until he saw which of the rivals was t
2 CONC o be victorious. Clovis longed to have revenge. Through a ruse he obtaine
2 CONC d possession of Chararic and his son and threw them into prison; he the
2 CONC n had their heads shaved, and both were ordained, the father to the pries
2 CONC thood and the son to the diaconate. When Chararic bemoaned and wept ove
2 CONC r this humiliation his son exclaimed: 'The leaves of a green tree have be
2 CONC en cut but they will quickly bud forth again; may he who has done this pe
2 CONC rish as quickly!' This remark was reported to Clovis, and he had both fat
2 CONC her and son beheaded. Tradition goes on to say that Ragnacaire King of C
2 CONC ambrai, was a man of such loose morals he hardly respected his own kindre
2 CONC d, and Farron, his favourite, was equally licentious. So great was the ki
2 CONC ng's infatuation for this man that, if given a present, he would accept i
2 CONC t for himself and his Farron. This filled his subjects with indignation a
2 CONC nd Clovis, to win them over to his side before taking the field, distribu
2 CONC ted among them money, bracelets, and baldries, all in gilded copper in fr
2 CONC audulent imitation of genuine gold. On different occasions Ragnacaire sen
2 CONC t out spies to ascertain the strength of Clovis's army, and upon returnin
2 CONC g they said: 'It is a great reinforcement for you and your Farron.' Meanw
2 CONC hile Clovis advanced and the battle began. Being defeated, Ragnacaire sou
2 CONC ght refuge in flight, but was overtaken; made prisoner, and brought to Cl
2 CONC ovis, his hands bound behind him. 'Why', said his conqueror have you perm
2 CONC itted our blood to be humiliated by allowing yourself to be put in chains
2 CONC ? It were better that you should die.' And, so saying, Clovis dealt him h
2 CONC is death-blow. Then, turning to Richaire, Ragnacaire's brother, who had b
2 CONC een taken prisoner with the king, he said: 'Had you but helped your broth
2 CONC er, they would not have bound him', and he slew Richaire also. After thes
2 CONC e deaths the traitors discovered that they had been given counterfeit gol
2 CONC d and complained of it to Clovis, but he only laughed at them. Rignomir
2 CONC , one of Ragnacaire's brothers, was put to death at Le Mans by order of C
2 CONC lovis, who took possession of the kingdom and the treasure of his victims
2 CONC . Such is the legend of Clovis; it abounds in all kinds of improbabiliti
2 CONC es, which cannot be considered as true history. The only facts that can b
2 CONC e accepted are that Clovis made war upon Kings Ragnacaire and Chararic, p
2 CONC ut them to death and seized their territories. Moreover, the author of th
2 CONC is article is of opinion that these events occurred shortly after the con
2 CONC quest of the territory of Syagrius, and not after the war against the Vis
2 CONC igoths, as has been maintained by Gregory of Tours, whose only authorit
2 CONC y is an oral tradition, and whose chronology in this matter is decidedl
2 CONC y misleading. Besides Gregory of Tours has not given us the name of Chara
2 CONC ric's kingdom; it was long believed to have been established at Therouann
2 CONC e but it is more probable that Tongres was its capital city, since it wa
2 CONC s here that the Franks settled on gaining a foothold in Belgium. In 49
2 CONC 2 or 493 Clovis, who was master of Gaul from the Loire to the frontiers o
2 CONC f the Rhenish Kingdom of Cologne, married Clotilda, the niece of Gondebad
2 CONC , King of the Burgundians. The popular epic of the Franks has transforme
2 CONC d the story of this marriage into a veritable nuptial poem the analysis o
2 CONC f which will be found in the article on Clotilda. Clotilda, who was a Cat
2 CONC holic, and very pious, won the consent of Clovis to the baptism of thei
2 CONC r son, and then urged that he himself embrace the Catholic Faith. He deli
2 CONC berated for a long time. Finally, during a battle against the Alemanni--w
2 CONC hich without apparent reason has been called the battle of Tolbiac (Zulpi
2 CONC ch)--seeing his troops on the point of yielding, he invoked the aid of Cl
2 CONC otilda's God, promised to become a Christian if only victory should be gr
2 CONC anted him. He conquered and, true to his word was baptized at Reims by St
2 CONC . Remigius, bishop of that city, his sister Albofledis and three thousan
2 CONC d of his warriors at the same time embracing Christianity. Gregory of Tou
2 CONC rs, in his ecclesiastical history of the Franks has described this event
2 CONC , which took place amid great pomp at Christmas, 496. 'Bow thy head, O Si
2 CONC cambrian', said St. Remigius to the royal convert 'Adore what thou hast b
2 CONC urned and burn what thou hast adored.' According to a ninth-century legen
2 CONC d found in the life of St. Remigius, written by the celebrated Hinemar hi
2 CONC mself Archbishop of Reims, the chrism for the baptismal ceremony was miss
2 CONC ing and was brought from heaven in a vase (ampulla) borne by a dove. Thi
2 CONC s is what is known as the Sainte Ampoule of Reims, preserved in the treas
2 CONC ury of the cathedral of that city and used for the coronation of the king
2 CONC s of France from Philip Augustus down to Charles X. The conversion of Cl
2 CONC ovis to the religion of the majority of his subjects soon brought about t
2 CONC he union of the Gallo-Romans with their barbarian conquerors. While in al
2 CONC l the other Germanic kingdoms founded on the ruins of the Roman Empire th
2 CONC e difference of religion between the Catholic natives and Arian conquerer
2 CONC s was a very active cause of destruction, in the Frankish kingdom, on th
2 CONC e contrary, the fundamental identity of religious beliefs and equality o
2 CONC f political rights made national and patriotic sentiments universal and p
2 CONC roduced the most perfect harmony between the two races. The Frankish King
2 CONC dom was thenceforth the representative and defender of Catholic interest
2 CONC s throughout the West, while to his conversion Clovis owed an exceptional
2 CONC ly brilliant position. Those historians who do not understand the problem
2 CONC s of religious psychology have concluded that Clovis embraced Christianit
2 CONC y solely from political motives, but nothing is more erroneous. On the co
2 CONC ntrary, everything goes to prove that his conversion was sincere, and th
2 CONC e opposite cannot be maintained without refusing credence to the most tru
2 CONC stworthy evidence. In the year 500 Clovis was called upon to mediate i
2 CONC n a quarrel between his wife's two uncles, Kings Gondebad of Vienne and G
2 CONC odegisil of Geneva. He took sides with the latter, whom he helped to defe
2 CONC at Gondebad at Dijon, and then, deeming it prudent to interfere no furthe
2 CONC r in this fratricidal struggle, he returned home, leaving Godegisil an au
2 CONC xiliary corps of five thousand Franks. After Clovis's departure Gondeba
2 CONC d reconquered Vienne, his capital in which Godegisil had established hims
2 CONC elf. This reconquest was effected by a stratagem seconded by treachery, a
2 CONC nd Godegisil himself perished on the same occasion. The popular poetry o
2 CONC f the Franks has singularly misrepresented this intervention of Clovis, p
2 CONC retending that, at the instigation of his wife Clotilda, he sought to ave
2 CONC nge her grievances against her uncle Gondebad (see CLOTILDA) and that th
2 CONC e latter king, besieged in Avignon by Clovis, got rid of his opponent thr
2 CONC ough the agency of Aredius, a faithful follower. But in these poems ther
2 CONC e are so many fictions as to render the history in them indistinguishable
2 CONC . An expedition, otherwise important and profitable was undertaken by Cl
2 CONC ovis in the year 506 against Alaric II, King of the Visigoths of Aquitain
2 CONC e. He was awaited as their deliverer by the Catholics of that kingdom, wh
2 CONC o were being cruelly persecuted by Arian fanatics, and was encouraged i
2 CONC n his enterprise by the Emperor Anastasius, who wished to crush this all
2 CONC y of Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths. Despite the diplomatic efforts ma
2 CONC de by the latter to prevent the war, Clovis crossed the Loire and proceed
2 CONC ed to Vouille, near Poitiers, where he defeated and slew Alaric, whose de
2 CONC moralized troops fled in disorder. The Franks took possession of the Visi
2 CONC goth Kingdom as far as the Pyrenees and the Rhone, but the part situate
2 CONC d on the left bank of this river was stoutly defended by the armies of Th
2 CONC eodoric, and thus the Franks were prevented from seizing Arles and Proven
2 CONC ce. Notwithstanding this last failure, Clovis, by his conquest of Aquitai
2 CONC ne, added to the Frankish crown the fairest of its jewels. So greatly di
2 CONC d the Emperor Anastasius rejoice over the success attained by Clovis that
2 CONC , to testify his satisfaction, he sent the Frankish conqueror the insigni
2 CONC a of the consular dignity, an honour always highly appreciated by the bar
2 CONC barians. The annexation of the Rhenish Kingdom of Cologne crowned the ac
2 CONC quisition of Gaul by Clovis. But the history of this conquest, also, ha
2 CONC s been disfigured by a legend that Clovis instigated Chloderic, son of Si
2 CONC gebert of Cologne, to assassinate his father, then, after the perpetratio
2 CONC n of this foul deed, caused Chloderic himself to be assassinated, and fin
2 CONC ally offered himself to the Rhenish Franks as king, protesting his innoce
2 CONC nce of the crimes that had been committed. The only historical element i
2 CONC n this old story, preserved by Gregory of Tours, is that the two kings o
2 CONC f Cologne met with violent deaths, and that that Clovis, their relative
2 CONC , succeeded them partly by right of birth, partly by popular choice. Th
2 CONC e criminal means by which he is said to have reached this throne are pur
2 CONC e creation of the barbarian imagination. Master now of a vast kingdom, Cl
2 CONC ovis displayed the same talent in governing that he had displayed in conq
2 CONC uering it. From Paris, which he had finally made his capital, he administ
2 CONC ered the various provinces through the agency of counts (comites) establi
2 CONC shed in each city and selected by him from the aristocracy of both races
2 CONC , conformably to the principle of absolute equality between Romans and ba
2 CONC rbarians, a principle which dominated his entire policy. He caused the Sa
2 CONC lic Law (Lex Salica) to be reduced to written form, revised end adapted t
2 CONC o the new social conditions under which his fellow barbaricans were subse
2 CONC quently to live. Acknowledging the Church as the foremost civilizing forc
2 CONC e, he protected it in every way possible, especially by providing for i
2 CONC t the National Council of Orleans (511), at which the bishops of Gaul set
2 CONC tled many questions pertaining to the relations between Church and state
2 CONC . Hagiographic legends attribute to Clovis the founding of a great many c
2 CONC hurches and monasteries throughout France, and although the accuracy of t
2 CONC his claim cannot be positively established, it is nevertheless certain th
2 CONC at the influence of the council in this matter must have been considerabl
2 CONC e. However, history has preserved the memory of foundation which was undo
2 CONC ubtedly due to Clovis: the church of the Apostles, later of Sainte-Genevi
2 CONC eve, on what was then Mons Lucotetius, to the south of Paris. The king de
2 CONC stined it as a mausoleum for himself and his queen Clotilda, and before i
2 CONC t was completed his mortal remains were there interred. Clovis died at th
2 CONC e age of forty-five. His sarcophagus remained in the crypt of Sainte-Gene
2 CONC vieve until the time of the French Revolution, when it was broken open b
2 CONC y the revolutionists, and his ashes scattered to the winds, the sanctuar
2 CONC y of the beautiful church being destroyed. The history of this monarch h
2 CONC as been so hopelessly distorted by popular poetry and so grossly disfigur
2 CONC ed by the vagaries of the barbarian imagination as make the portrayal o
2 CONC f his character wellneigh impossible. However, from authentic accounts o
2 CONC f him it may be concluded that his private life was not without virtues
2 CONC . As a statesman he succeeded in accomplishing what neither the genius o
2 CONC f Theodoric the Great nor that of any contemporary barbarian king could a
2 CONC chieve: upon the ruins of the Roman Empire he built up a powerful system
2 CONC , the influence of which dominated European civilization during many cent
2 CONC uries, and from which sprang France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and Switz
2 CONC erland, without taking into account that northern Spain and northern Ital
2 CONC y were also, for a time, under the civilizing regime of the Frankish Empi
2 CONC re. Clovis left four sons. Theodoric, the eldest, was the issue of unio
2 CONC n prior to that contracted with Clotilda, who was, however, the mother o
2 CONC f the three others, Clodomir, Childebert, and Clotaire. They divided thei
2 CONC r father's kingdom among themselves, following the barbarian principle th
2 CONC at sought promotion of personal rather than national interests, and looke
2 CONC d upon royalty as the personal prerogative of the sons of kings. After th
2 CONC e death of Clovis his daughter Clotilda, named after her mother, marrie
2 CONC d Amalric, king of the Visigoths. She died young, being cruelly abused b
2 CONC y this Arian prince, who seemed eager to wreak vengeance on the daughte

1 NOTE When Bardanes Turcus and Nicephorus I were fighting over the Byzantine th
2 CONC rone in 803, Leo at first joined Bardanes but later sided with Nicephorus
2 CONC . Leo distinguished himself as a general under Nicephorus I and Michae
2 CONC l I and became 'strategus' (general) of the Anatolikon district of the em
2 CONC pire. He took part in the campaign of 813 against the Bulgars but, when M
2 CONC ichael unwisely refused the peace terms they offered, the Asian troops un
2 CONC der Leo deserted at the Battle of Versinkia, near Adrianople. Leo then de
2 CONC posed Michael I and, in July 813, replaced him. Meanwhile, Krum, the Bulg
2 CONC arian Khan, had reached the walls of Constantinople. Leo succeeded in dra
2 CONC wing him back and concluded a treaty with Krum's successor, Omortag, tha
2 CONC t determined the boundary between the two countries and provided a 30-yea
2 CONC r peace. In March 815 Leo deposed the Orthodox patriarch Nicephorus and c
2 CONC onvoked a synod for the following month that reimposed the decrees of th
2 CONC e Iconoclast synod of Hieria of 754, which had opposed the use of icons (
2 CONC religious images). Leo was assasinated during a Christmas service in th
2 CONC e church of Hagia Sophia by friends of Michael the Amorian, whom Leo ha
2 CONC d condemned to death the day before on a charge of treason. After the mur
2 CONC der Michael ascended the throne as Michael II.

1 NOTE FROM: www.britannica.com Charles Martel b. c. 688 d. Oct. 22, 741, Qui
2 CONC erzy-sur-Oise, France Latin CAROLUS MARTELLUS, German KARL MARTELL, mayo
2 CONC r of the palace of Austrasia (the eastern part of the Frankish kingdom) f
2 CONC rom 715 to 741. He reunited and ruled the entire Frankish realm and stemm
2 CONC ed the Muslim invasion at Poitiers in 732. His byname, Martel, means 'th
2 CONC e hammer.' Charles was the illegitimate son of Pepin of Herstal, the mayo
2 CONC r of the palace of Austrasia. By this period the Merovingian kings of th
2 CONC e Frankish realm were rulers in name only. The burden of rule lay upon th
2 CONC e mayors of the palace, who governed Austrasia, the eastern part of the F
2 CONC rankish kingdom, and Neustria, its western portion. Neustria bitterly res
2 CONC ented its conquest and annexation in 687 by Pepin, who, acting in the nam
2 CONC e of the king, had reorganized and reunified the Frankish realm. The ass
2 CONC assination of Pepin's only surviving legitimate son in 714 was followe
2 CONC d a few months later by the death of Pepin himself. Pepin left as heirs t
2 CONC hree grandsons, and until they came of age, Plectrude, Pepin's widow, wa
2 CONC s to hold power. As an illegitimate son, Charles Martel was entirely negl
2 CONC ected in the will. But he was young, strong, and determined, and an inten
2 CONC se struggle for power at once broke out in the Frankish kingdom. Both Ch
2 CONC arles and Plectrude faced rebellion throughout the Frankish kingdom whe
2 CONC n Pepin's will was made known. The king, Chilperic II, was in the power o
2 CONC f Ragenfrid, mayor of the palace of Neustria, who joined forces with th
2 CONC e Frisians in Holland in order to eliminate Charles. Plectrude imprisone
2 CONC d Charles and tried to govern in the name of her grandchildren, but Charl
2 CONC es escaped, gathered an army, and defeated the Neustrians in battles at A
2 CONC mbleve near Liege (716) and at Vincy near Cambrai (717). His success mad
2 CONC e resistance by Plectrude and the Austrasians useless; they submitted, an
2 CONC d by 719 Charles alone governed the Franks as mayor. Assured of Austrasi
2 CONC a, Charles now attacked Neustria itself, finally subduing it in 724. Thi
2 CONC s freed Charles to deal with hostile elements elsewhere. He attacked Aqui
2 CONC taine, whose ruler, Eudes (Odo), had been an ally of Ragenfrid, but Charl
2 CONC es did not gain effective control of southern France until late in his re
2 CONC ign. He also conducted long campaigns, some as late as the 730s, agains
2 CONC t the Frisians, Saxons, and Bavarians, whose brigandage endangered the ea
2 CONC stern frontiers of his kingdom. In order to consolidate his military gain
2 CONC s, Charles supported St. Boniface and other missionaries in their effort
2 CONC s to convert the German tribes on the eastern frontier to Christianity. 
2 CONC Ever since their arrival in Spain from Africa in 711, the Muslims had rai
2 CONC ded Frankish territory, threatening Gaul and on one occasion (725) reachi
2 CONC ng Burgundy and sacking Autun. In 732 'Abd ar-Rahman, the governor of CA3
2 CONC rdoba, marched into Bordeaux and defeated Eudes. The Muslims then proceed
2 CONC ed north across Aquitaine to the city of Poitiers. Eudes appealed to Char
2 CONC les for assistance, and Charles' cavalry managed to turn back the Musli
2 CONC m onslaught at the Battle of Poitiers. The battle itself may have been on
2 CONC ly a series of small engagements, but after it there were no more great M
2 CONC uslim invasions of Frankish territory. In 733 Charles began his campaign
2 CONC s to force Burgundy to yield to his rule. In 735 word arrived that Eude
2 CONC s was dead, and Charles marched rapidly across the Loire River in order t
2 CONC o make his power felt around Bordeaux. By 739 he had completely subdued t
2 CONC he petty chieftains of Burgundy, and he continued to fend off Muslim adva
2 CONC nces into Gaul during the decade. Charles' health began to fail in the l
2 CONC ate 730s, and in 741 he retired to his palace at Quierzy-sur-Oise, wher
2 CONC e he died soon after. Before his death he divided the Merovingian kingdo
2 CONC m between his two legitimate sons, Pepin and Carloman. He continued to ma
2 CONC intain the fiction of Merovingian rule, refraining from transferring th
2 CONC e royal title to his own dynasty.

1 NOTE Chosen Duke of Austrasia (in France) in 714, he became mayor of the palac
2 CONC e of King Clothaire IV in 720 and was the true ruler of theFranks. His fi
2 CONC rst battles were with the Saxons, Alemanni and Bavarians. However, his im
2 CONC portance was established when he rolled back the tide of the Saracen Mosl
2 CONC em conquest in a desperate battle between Tours and Poitiers in 732. Prio
2 CONC r to the battle, Abdul Rahman, the Arab governor of Spain, had won a grea
2 CONC t battle near Bordeaux. This Moslem threat united the Burgundians and th
2 CONC e Gauls of Provence who then acknowledged sovereignty to Charles Martel
2 CONC , as they saw him as their saviour from the Moslem conquests. The battl
2 CONC e at Poitiers, now almost forgotten, must rank among the most important a
2 CONC s it halted the Moslem conquest of Europe. Charles finished his work by d
2 CONC riving the Saracens out of Burgundy and the Languedoc in 737. Great as h
2 CONC e was, he never aspired to being more than "mayor of the palace" and Duk
2 CONC e of Austrasia. When he died in 741, his sons, Carloman and Pepin, stil
2 CONC l as joint mayors of the palace, divided the power for Merovingian King C
2 CONC hilderic III of the Franks.

1 NOTE FROM: The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001 http://www.bartleby.
2 CONC com  Austrasia (ostrA'zh), northeastern portion of the Merovingian kin
2 CONC gdom of the Franks  in the 6th, 7th, and 8th cent., comprising, in genera
2 CONC l, parts of E France, W Germany, and the Netherlands, with its capital va
2 CONC riously at Metz, Reims, and Soissons. It originated in the partition (511
2 CONC ) of the realm of the Frankish king Clovis I  among his four sons after h
2 CONC is death. Austrasia was constantly troubled by dynastic rivalries betwee
2 CONC n its rulers and those of the neighboring kingdom of Neustria. These stru
2 CONC ggles, both political and cultural, reached their climax in the fierce fi
2 CONC ghts between Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia and Queen Fredegunde of Neustri
2 CONC a. During the reigns of Clotaire I, Clotaire II, and Dagobert I, Austrasi
2 CONC a was temporarily reunited with Neustria. This rivalry was only part of t
2 CONC he regionalism that eventually brought an end to Merovingian rule. With t
2 CONC he decline of the royal power in Austrasia, the office of mayor of the pa
2 CONC lace developed into the real seat of power and finally became hereditar
2 CONC y in the family of the Carolingians. Austrasia became part of the Carolin
2 CONC gian empire. FROM: http://www.encyclopedia.com Pepin of Heristal (Pepi
2 CONC n II) heristl pepin, d. 714, mayor of the palace (680-714) of the Franki
2 CONC sh territory of Austrasia; grandson of Pepin of Landen and father of Char
2 CONC les Martel. After defeating the nobles of Neustria at the battle of Tertr
2 CONC y (687), Pepin made himself mayor, or ruler, of all the Frankish kingdom
2 CONC s except Aquitaine, with the Merovingian dynasty retaining the nominal ki
2 CONC ngship. He defeated the Frisians, the Alemanni, and the Bavarians and est
2 CONC ablished a strong government, thus laying the foundation for the empire o
2 CONC f his descendants, the Carolingian mayors and kings.

1 NOTE Having inherited the joint right to rule the kingdom of The Franks togeth
2 CONC er with his brother, he became sole ruler in 747 when Carloman retired in
2 CONC to the monastery of Monte Casino. In 751 he asked Pope Zacharias to end t
2 CONC he nominal rule of the Merovingians and have the power together with th
2 CONC e title of "King of The Franks". The Pope agreed and King Childeric III w
2 CONC as placed in a monastery. Saint Boniface anointed Pepin as King of The Fr
2 CONC anks at Soissons. Two years later---having saved the next pope, Stephen I
2 CONC I, from the Lombards ---Pepin was again anointed at the Abbey of St. Deni
2 CONC s, together with his two young sons, Charles and Carloman, by the pope hi
2 CONC mself. Pippin was a much more able king than the Merovingians "Rois faine
2 CONC ants" (do nothing kings). The Franks went to Italy to support the pope an
2 CONC d defeated Astolfo, King of the Lombards. Pippin was rewarded and mad
2 CONC e a senator of Rome even though he could neither read nor write. Afte
2 CONC r a subsequent attack on the pope, he again defeated Astolfo and made a g
2 CONC ift to the pope of Lombard lands near Rome. This bequest was the beginnin
2 CONC g of the pope's status as a temporal souvereign. Pippin died at the Abbe
2 CONC y of St. Denis in 768. His sons Charles and Carloman forthwith divided th
2 CONC e Frank domains. However, Carloman soon died leaving Charles, as the sol
2 CONC e ruler of the kingdom of The Franks, to become the most important rule
2 CONC r ever to have "the Great" added to his name. Charles The Great, or Carol
2 CONC us Magnus, then became better known as Charlemagne.

1 NOTE Profession : Roi de Mercie en 821.
2 SOUR @S216@
1 NOTE In AD 821, King Cenwulf of Mercia died at Basingwerk, while campaigning a
2 CONC gainst the Welsh of Powys. He left two daughters, Cwendreda and Burgenhil
2 CONC da, and a son, a child of seven years old, named Cenelm or, more commonl
2 CONC y these days, Cenelm, who was chosen to succeed him. Cwendreda envied he
2 CONC r little brother and thought that, if he were killed, she might reign a
2 CONC s Queen. She therefore conspired with her lover, Askbert, who was her bro
2 CONC ther's tutor and guardian, and gave him money, saying, "Slay my brother f
2 CONC or me, that I may reign." Burgenilda was not privy to this wicked deed, h
2 CONC owever, for she loved her little brother. 
2 CONT So, on 3rd November, Ascbert took Cenelm out into the Forests of Worcest
2 CONC ershire on a hunting trip. After the exertions of the chase, the young la
2 CONC d soon tired with the heat, and decided to lay down under a tree for a na
2 CONC p. Ascbert, meanwhile, began to dig a grave; but the boy suddenly awoke a
2 CONC nd admonished him, "You think to kill me here in vain, for I shall be sla
2 CONC in in another spot. In token, thereof, see this rod blossom." And he thru
2 CONC st a stick into the ground, which instantly took root and began to flower
2 CONC . It grew, in years after, to be a great ash tree, which was known as St
2 CONC . Kenelm's Ash. Unperturbed, Askbert took the little King further into th
2 CONC e forest and up to the Clent Hills, to Romsley (Worcs), where the child b
2 CONC egan to sing the "Te Deum," the assassin smote his head clean off; and th
2 CONC en he buried him in the thicket. 
2 CONT Now, at the same time, a white dove is said to have flown into the churc
2 CONC h of St. Peter in Rome, with a letter in its beak which it deposited on t
2 CONC he high altar. And men took the letter and tried to read, but they coul
2 CONC d not make it out, for it was written in English. At last, an Englishma
2 CONC n was found, however, and he read the letter. It stated that Cenelm, th
2 CONC e little King of the Mercians, had been cruelly murdered and his body hid
2 CONC den in a thicket. 
2 CONT So the Pope wrote letters to the kings of the English and told them wha
2 CONC t an evil deed had been done in their land, and men went forth to seek th
2 CONC e body. As they went, they saw a pillar of light shining over a thicket i
2 CONC n Worcestershire and, there, they found the body of Cenelm. They carrie
2 CONC d him to the Royal Mercian Abbey at Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire, wher
2 CONC e he was buried with all honour and revered as a martyr. But over the pla
2 CONC ce where they found his body, they built a little chapel. Today it is th
2 CONC e Church of St. Cenelm at Romsley in the Clent Hills. 
2 CONT The story of Cenelm appears to bear little relation to the known facts a
2 CONC bout him. Somewhat older than seven, he signed a number of his father's c
2 CONC harters between AD 798 & 811, he owned land in Glastonbury (Somerset) an
2 CONC d is thought to have died, fighting the Welsh, in AD 812. In an interesti
2 CONC ng twist, however, local historian, Roger Chambers, suggests that there w
2 CONC ere two Cenelm half-brothers, one named after the other, and that this ma
2 CONC y have been the elder of the two; Cenelm the younger being the Saint of p
2 CONC opular legend. His feast day is celebrated on 17th July, the date of hi
2 CONC s translation to Winchcombe.

1 NOTE When Prince Henry revolted against his father in 1173, Sir Robert deBoho

2 CONC al when Prince Henry persuaded William, the Lion King ofScotland, to joi

2 CONC d, the northernmost Shire of England.Humphrey, third baron de Bohon, le

2 CONC n Suffolk in 1173, and along withSir Richard de Lacy, met the forces of S
2 CONC cotland and Prince Henry onJuly 13, 1174. The battle ended in the complet
2 CONC e rout of the rebelliousforces. King William was captured and imprisoned
2 CONC . Sir Robert de Bohonfled to Scotland and Prince Henry was forgiven. Kin
2 CONC g William's sister,Princess Margaret of Scotland and the widow of Conan I
2 CONC V of Bretagne,Earl of Richmond, (d. 1170), was married to Humphrey de Boh
2 CONC on, theyoung Earl of Hereford was who heir of the third Baron de Bohon. S
2 CONC ir Robert le Bon died in 1183, four years before his father BaronHumphre
2 CONC y de Bohon's death. Consequently, when Humphrey the third Barondied in 11
2 CONC 87, he was succeeded by his 12 year old grandson, Henry(1176-1220) as fou
2 CONC rth Baron de Bohon. Upon coming of age, Henry wasknighted and made High C
2 CONC onstable of England and held manor houses andcastles at Caldicot, Haresfi
2 CONC eld, Oaksey and Walden in addition to themain Hereford holdings. A numbe
2 CONC r of months after Sir Robert de Bohon fled to Scotland, KingWilliam signe
2 CONC d the humiliating Treaty of Folaise and was released fromhis prison in No
2 CONC rmandy. Upon returning to Scotland, he awarded some ofhis followers inclu
2 CONC ding Sir Robert de Bohon, some land south ofGlasgow. Sir Robert spent lit
2 CONC tle time on his land as he was withPrince Henry who had been forgiven b
2 CONC y King Henry II. Unfortunately forSir Robert de Bohon, young Henry the cr
2 CONC own prince, died six yearsbefore his father. Sir Robert was with him at M
2 CONC artel in Aquitaine onJune 11, 1183 when it happened. As far as it is know
2 CONC n, Sir Robert de Bohon never returned to Englandbut lived out his life (d
2 CONC . after 1210) on his Scottish land and becamea highly respected manoria
2 CONC l lord. Legend has it that he was called 'leBon' ( the good). His son an
2 CONC d heir had similar characteristics so thathe too was known as Sir Richar

1 NOTE John was born on Christmas Eve 1167. His parents drifted apart afterhis b
2 CONC irth; his youth was divided between his eldest brother Henry'shouse, wher
2 CONC e he learned the art of knighthood, and the house of hisfather's justicia
2 CONC r, Ranulf Glanvil, where he learned the business ofgovernment. As the fou
2 CONC rth child, inherited lands were not available tohim, giving rise to his n
2 CONC ickname, Lackland. His first marriage lastedbut ten years and was fruitle
2 CONC ss, but his second wife, Isabella ofAngouleme, bore him two sons and thre
2 CONC e daughters. He also had anillegitimate daughter, Joan, who married Llywe
2 CONC lyn the Great, Ruler ofAll Wales, from which the Tudor line of monarchs w
2 CONC as descended. Thesurvival of the English government during John's reign i
2 CONC s a testamentto the reforms of his father, as John taxed the system socia
2 CONC lly,economically, and judicially. The Angevin family feuds profoundly mar
2 CONC ked John. He and Richardclashed in 1184 following Richard's refusal to ho
2 CONC nor his father'swishes surrender Aquitane to John. The following year Hen
2 CONC ry II sentJohn to rule Ireland, but John alienated both the native Iris
2 CONC h and thetransplanted Anglo-Normans who emigrated to carve out new lordsh
2 CONC ipsfor themselves; the experiment was a total failure and John returnedho
2 CONC me within six months. After Richard gained the throne in 1189, hegave Joh
2 CONC n vast estates in an unsuccessful attempt to appease hisyounger brother
2 CONC . John failed to overthrow Richard's administratorsduring the German capt
2 CONC ivity and conspired with Philip II in anotherfailed coup attempt. Upon Ri
2 CONC chard's release from captivity in 1194,John was forced to sue for pardo
2 CONC n and he spent the next five years inhis brother's shadow. John's reign w
2 CONC as troubled in many respects. A quarrel with the Churchresulted in Englan
2 CONC d being placed under an interdict in 1207, with Johnactually excommunicat
2 CONC ed two years later. The dispute centered onJohn's stubborn refusal to ins
2 CONC tall the papal candidate, StephenLangdon, as Archbishop of Canterbury; th
2 CONC e issue was not resolved untilJohn surrendered to the wishes of Pope Inno
2 CONC cent III and paid tributefor England as the Pope's vassal. John proved ex
2 CONC tremely unpopular with his subjects. In addition to theIrish debacle, h
2 CONC e inflamed his French vassals by orchestrating themurder of his popular n
2 CONC ephew, Arthur of Brittany. By spring 1205, helost the last of his Frenc
2 CONC h possessions and returned to England. Thefinal ten years of his reign we
2 CONC re occupied with failed attempts toregain these territories. After levyin
2 CONC g a number of new taxes upon thebarons to pay for his dismal campaigns, t
2 CONC he discontented baronsrevolted, capturing London in May 1215. At Runnymea
2 CONC de in the followingJune, John succumbed to pressure from the barons, th
2 CONC e Church, and theEnglish people at-large, and signed the Magna Carta. Th
2 CONC e document, adeclaration of feudal rights, stressed three points. First
2 CONC , the Churchwas free to make ecclesiastic appointments. Second, larger-th
2 CONC an-normalamounts of money could only be collected with the consent of the
2 CONC king's feudal tenants. Third, no freeman was to be punished exceptwithi
2 CONC n the context of common law. Magna Carta, although a testament toJohn's c
2 CONC omplete failure as monarch, was the forerunner of modernconstitutions. Jo
2 CONC hn only signed the document as a means of buying timeand his hesitance t
2 CONC o implement its principles compelled the nobilityto seek French assistanc
2 CONC e. The barons offered the throne to PhilipII's son, Louis. John died in t
2 CONC he midst of invasion from the French inthe South and rebellion from his b
2 CONC arons in the North. John was remembered in elegant fashion by Sir Richar

1 NOTE Encyclopedia Britannica Online, article titled 'Henry the YoungKing:' 'al
2 CONC so called HENRY FITZHENRY, second son of King Henry II of Englandby Elean
2 CONC or of Aquitaine; he was regarded, after the death of his elderbrother, Wi
2 CONC lliam, in 1156, as his father's successor in England,Normandy, and Anjou
2 CONC . 'In 1158 Henry, only three years of age, was betrothed to Margaret,daug
2 CONC hter of Louis VII of France and his second wife, on condition thatMargare
2 CONC t's dowry would be the Vexin, the border region betweenNormandy (then hel
2 CONC d by England) and France. Henry II took advantage ofPope Alexander III'
2 CONC s political difficulties to secure the Pope'spermission for the childre
2 CONC n to be married in 1160. On June 14, 1170,the young Henry was crowned kin
2 CONC g (theoretically to rule in associationwith his father) at Westminster b
2 CONC y Archbishop Roger of York. York'sofficiation, usurping a prerogative o
2 CONC f the archbishop of Canterbury,exacerbated the dispute between the latter
2 CONC , namely, Thomas Becket, andHenry II, which ended with Becket's murder si
2 CONC x months later. Crownedagain on Aug. 27, 1172 (this time with Margaret)
2 CONC , the Young Kingreceived no share of his father's power. (He was neverthe
2 CONC less calledby contemporaries and by certain later chroniclers King Henr
2 CONC y III.) 'With his mother and his brothers Richard (the future Richard I
2 CONC ) andGeoffrey, he nearly overthrew Henry II in 1173. Forgiven for thisrev
2 CONC olt, he intrigued further against his father with Louis VII. In1182-83 h
2 CONC e waged war against Richard over Poitou, and he was preparingto fight Ric
2 CONC hard again when he died in France of dysentery. 'The Young King was so po
2 CONC pular that the people of Le Mans and Rouenalmost went to war for the cust

2 CONC pt by John and regained landslost to Philip II during the German captivit
2 CONC y. Richard's war withPhilip continued sporadically until the French wer

2 CONC 'Richard's prowess and courage in battle earned him the nickname CoeurD

2 CONC vealed in a verse Richard composed during his german captivity

2 CONC y V, Count of those Regions). He wasthirteen, she twenty-three. It is tho
2 CONC ught that the two never got on.However, despite this unhappy situation th
2 CONC ey had had three sons infour years. Being absent in Anjou at the time o
2 CONC f her father's death on 1stDecember 1135, possibly due to pregnancy, Mati
2 CONC lda was not in much of aposition to take up the throne which had been pro
2 CONC mised her and shequickly lost out to her fast-moving cousin, Stephen. Wit
2 CONC h her husband,she attempted to take Normandy. With encouragement from sup
2 CONC porters inEngland though, it was not long before Matilda invaded her righ
2 CONC tfulEnglish domain and so began a long-standing Civil War from thepowerba
2 CONC se of her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, in the WestCountry. After t
2 CONC hree years of armed struggle, she at last gained the upper handat the Bat
2 CONC tle of Lincoln, in February 1141, where King Stephen wascaptured. However
2 CONC , despite being declared Queen or 'Lady of theEnglish' at Winchester an
2 CONC d winning over Stephen's brother, Henry ofBlois, the powerful Bishop of W
2 CONC inchester, Matilda alienated thecitizens of London with her arrogant mann
2 CONC er. She failed to secure hercoronation and the Londoners joined a renewe
2 CONC d push from Stephen'sQueen and laid siege to the Empress in Winchester. S
2 CONC he managed toescape to the West, but while commanding her rearguard, he
2 CONC r brotherwas captured by the enemy. Matilda was obliged to swap Stephen f
2 CONC or Robert on 1st November 1141.Thus the King soon reimposed his Royal aut
2 CONC hority. In 1148, after thedeath of her half-brother, Matilda finally retu
2 CONC rned to Normandy,leaving her son, who, in 1154, would become Henry II, t
2 CONC o fight on inEngland. She died at Rouen on 10th September 1169 and was bu
2 CONC ried inFontevrault Abbey, though some of her entrails may possibly have b
2 CONC eenlater interred in her father's foundation at Reading Abbey. She was th
2 CONC e Empress of Germany. From Encyclopedia Britannica Online,article entitle
2 CONC d Matilda: 'Her brother's [William the Aetheling] death in 1120 made he
2 CONC r HenryI's sole legitimate heir, and in 1127 he compelled the baronage to
2 CONC accept her as his successor, though a woman ruler was equallyunprecedente
2 CONC d for the kingdom of England and the duchy of Normandy.The  Angevin marri
2 CONC age was unpopular and flouted the barons'stipulation that she should  no
2 CONC t be married out of England withouttheir consent. The birth of her eldes
2 CONC t son, Henry, in 1133 gave hopeof silencing this opposition, but he was o
2 CONC nly two when Henry I died(1135), and a rapid coup brought to the Englis
2 CONC h throne Stephen ofBlois,  son of William I the Conqueror's daughter Adel
2 CONC a. Though thechurch and the majority of the baronage supported Stephen, M
2 CONC atilda'sclaims were powerfully upheld in England by her half brother Robe
2 CONC rt ofGloucester and her uncle King David I of Scotland. Matilda and Rober
2 CONC tlanded at Arundel in September 1139, and she was for a short whilebesieg
2 CONC ed in the castle. But Stephen soon allowed her to join herbrother, who ha
2 CONC d gone to the west country, where she had much support;after a stay at Br
2 CONC istol, she settled at Gloucester. 'She came nearest to success in the sum
2 CONC mer of 1141, after Stephen hadbeen captured at Lincoln in February. Elect
2 CONC ed 'lady of the English' bya clerical council at Winchester in April, sh

2 CONC hereafter shemaintained a steadily weakening resistance in the west count
2 CONC ry. Herwell-known escape from Oxford Castle over the frozen River Thame
2 CONC s tookplace in December 1142. 'Normandy had been in her husband's possess

1 NOTE Roger Mortimer, 2nd Baron of Mortimer, was summoned to Parliament1306-132
2 CONC 6. This nobleman, notorious in our histories as the paramourof Isabel, Qu
2 CONC een Consort of Edward II, was in his sixteenth year atthe death of his fa
2 CONC ther. He married Jaone, daughter of Peter deGenville, Lord of Trim, in Ir
2 CONC eland. In 34th of Edward I, about 1306,he received the honour of Knightho
2 CONC od. He aided in the Scottish wars,and in 3rd of Edward II, 1310, he was m
2 CONC ade Governor of the Castle ofBuelt, and later was Lord Lieutenant of Irel
2 CONC and. During the latterpart of Edward II's reign he attached himself to th
2 CONC e Queen, and atlength fled with her and Prince Edward to France. He late
2 CONC r returnedand was made Earl of March soon after the accession of Edward I
2 CONC II. Hehereupon became proud beyond measure (so that his son Geoffrey call
2 CONC edhim the King of Folly) and assumed royal authority. His career was noth
2 CONC owever of long continuance, for King Edward III, becoming sensible ofhi
2 CONC s folly and vices, had him seized in the Castle of Queen Isabel inNotting
2 CONC ham and was convicted under various charges, the first wascomplicity in t
2 CONC he murder of Edward II, and receiving sentence of deathwas hanged in 1330
2 CONC . He left by Joan de Geneville 4 sons and 7daughters. By marriage to Joan
2 CONC na de Geneville, a later Roger Mortimer (1287-1330)secured possession o
2 CONC f Ludlow Castle. This became the family'sprincipal power base for the nex
2 CONC t six generations. Roger Mortimer was a very powerful and ambitious March
2 CONC er Lord. He wasthe first of several members of his family to attempt to s
2 CONC eize thethrone of England. He fought the Scottish Wars and made attempt
2 CONC s toremove the King's favorites, at first with some success. In 1323 hewa
2 CONC s imprisoned in the Tower of London, but escaped to France, an eventhe la
2 CONC ter commemorated by building St Peter's chapel in the outerbailey of Ludl
2 CONC ow Castle. In France, Mortimer formed an alliance with Queen Isabella, wh
2 CONC o haddeserted her effeminate husband, King Edward II of England. Theyrais
2 CONC ed an army, invaded England and forced Edward to abdicate in favorof hi
2 CONC s youngest son, the future Edward III. Mortimer entertainedIsabella at hi
2 CONC s castles on the Welsh borders and they became famouslovers. Meanwhile, E
2 CONC dward II was cruelly murdered at Berkeley Castlein 1327. Following Edward
2 CONC 's death, Mortimer, acting as regent, was the virtualruler of England, bu
2 CONC t he over-reached himself and aroused the anger ofother barons. In Octobe
2 CONC r 1330 he was arrested at Nottingham andsentenced to death. He was execut
2 CONC ed at Tyburn in London. Later, the ambitions of the Mortimers became par
2 CONC t of the greatdynastic struggles of the mid-15th century which became kno
2 CONC wn as the'War of the Roses.'  From Encyclopedia Britannica Online, articl
2 CONC e titled: 'March, RogerMortimer, 1st Earl of, 8th Baron Of Wigmore' 'love
2 CONC r of the English King Edward II's queen, Isabella of France, withwhom h
2 CONC e contrived Edward's deposition and murder (1327). For threeyears thereaf
2 CONC ter he was virtual king of England during the minority ofEdward III. 'Th
2 CONC e descendant of Norman knights who had accompanied William theConqueror
2 CONC , he inherited wealthy family estates and fortunes,principally in Wales a
2 CONC nd Ireland, and in 1304 became 8th Baron ofWigmore on the death of his fa
2 CONC ther, the 7th baron. He devoted theearly years of his majority to obtaini
2 CONC ng effective control of hisIrish lordships against his wife's kinsmen, th
2 CONC e Lacys, who summoned totheir aid Edward Bruce, brother of King Rober
2 CONC t I of Scotland, when hewas fighting to become king of Ireland. In 1316 M
2 CONC ortimer was defeatedat Kells and withdrew to England, but afterward, as K
2 CONC ing Edward II'slieutenant in Ireland (November 1316), he was largely inst
2 CONC rumental inovercoming Bruce and in driving the Lacys from Meath. 'In 131
2 CONC 7 he was associated with the Earl of Pembroke's 'middle party'in Englis
2 CONC h politics; but distrust of the Despensers (see Despenser,Hugh Le and Hug
2 CONC h Le) drove him, in common with other marcher lords,into opposition and v
2 CONC iolent conflict with the Despensers in SouthWales in 1321. But, receivin
2 CONC g no help from Edward II's other enemies,Roger and his uncle Roger Mortim
2 CONC er of Chirk made their submission inJanuary 1322. Imprisoned in the Towe
2 CONC r of London, Roger escaped in 1323and fled to France, where in 1325 he wa
2 CONC s joined by Queen Isabella, whobecame his mistress.  The exiles invaded E
2 CONC ngland in September 1326;the fall of the Despensers was followed by the d
2 CONC eposition of Edward IIand his subsequent murder (1327), in which Mortime
2 CONC r was deeplyimplicated. 'Thereafter, as the queen's paramour, Mortimer vi
2 CONC rtually ruledEngland. He used his position to further his own ends. Creat
2 CONC ed Earl ofMarch in October 1328, he secured for himself the lordships ofD
2 CONC enbigh, Oswestry, and Clun, formerly belonging to the Earl ofArundel; th
2 CONC e marcher lordships of the Mortimers of Chirk; andMontgomery, granted t
2 CONC o him by the queen. His insatiable avarice, hisarrogance, and his unpopul
2 CONC ar policy toward Scotland aroused againstMortimer a general revulsion amo
2 CONC ng his fellow barons, and in October1330 the young king Edward III, at th
2 CONC e instigation of Henry ofLancaster, had him seized at Nottingham and conv
2 CONC eyed to the Tower.Condemned for crimes declared to be notorious by his pe
2 CONC ers inParliament, he was hanged at Tyburn as a traitor, and his estates w
2 CONC ereforfeited to the crown.'

2 NOTE King Henry I   By: Ryan Engler   The death of King Henry I in 1135 put He
3 CONC nry II on the path to thethrone of England. Henry II lavish youth kept hi
3 CONC m sheltered fromsociety only allowing him to have a couple friends. One o
3 CONC f his lifelong friends soon became a burden because of differences in opi
3 CONC nionsabout religion. Henry's intelligence and persistency from birth ledh
3 CONC im to be crowned King of England. The appointment of Thomas Becket toArch
3 CONC bishop by Henry II started the trend of conflict between the twoover th
3 CONC e separation of church and state. Henry II, the first of thePlantagents w
3 CONC as the son of Geoffrey Plantagent and Matilda, daughterof Henry I. In 115
3 CONC 2 Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine, the ex-wife ofLouis VII of France
3 CONC . With this marriage, Henry gained considerableamounts of land in France
3 CONC . In 1153 Henry returned to England   afterhis stay in France and force
3 CONC d Stephens to name him the heir of thethrone. Henry immediately appointe
3 CONC d his long-term friend ThomasBecket, English Chancellor, to be Archbisho
3 CONC p of Canterbury. Becketaccepted the job of Archbishop in 1162 but he di
3 CONC d it with somereluctance. Becket's unkind heart soon became a thorn in He
3 CONC nry'sside.(Hay 107) By 1163, Becket had already defied Henry in one of hi
3 CONC sdecisions. He challenged his former friend in his vehement todismantle t
3 CONC he ecclesiastical courts. Becket became an ardent defenderof the interest
3 CONC s of the church. Becket's hard-nosed attitude towardsdefending the Churc
3 CONC h of England showed just how important the churchwas to England. 'The aff
3 CONC airs between Henry and Becket became a highlycolored by their personal re
3 CONC lationships.'('Henry II')   Their life long friendship was the only thin
3 CONC g that kept the two onthe same side. Another strong disagreement came bet
3 CONC ween the two on thestatus of 'criminous clerics.' These were members of t
3 CONC he clergy whohad committed civil crimes. The crimes ranged from theft t
3 CONC o assaultand even murder. This became a total embarrassment to the church
3 CONC .Henry sought to have the members tried in the royal court, as wouldother
3 CONC s who committed such crimes. Becket insisted that they only betried in th
3 CONC e clerical courts. The disagreement became a heated battlebetween the two
3 CONC . Becket stood firm on his belief that the mattershould not be brought t
3 CONC o a higher court. The situation would onlybring even more embarrassment t
3 CONC o the Church of England if the memberswere crucified in the public courts
3 CONC .(Bowden 78) The situation becamesuch a heated battle between the two tha
3 CONC t in 1164 Becket sought refugein France. During Becket's exile, Henry beg
3 CONC an to straighten up thecountry and straighten up the courts system. Henr
3 CONC y also marched in andconquered Brittany without much opposition. During t
3 CONC his time greatreforms were made to the English law system. Henry used his
3 CONC intelligence and energy to make lasting changes in England. Severalimport
3 CONC ant legal reforms were made to the English Common Law. Henrycontinued t
3 CONC o freely change and control the church without anyopposition. Through th
3 CONC e auspices of Pope Cutittus III, King andArchbishop were reconciled in 11
3 CONC 70 and Becket was allowed to return toEngland. No sooner than he returne
3 CONC d the two found themselves bickeringover their different ideas. Neither o
3 CONC f the two would yield theirprincipals to each other. While Henry was awa
3 CONC y in Normandy word ofBecket's actions were relayed to Henry. This outrage
3 CONC d Henry thatBecket could take advantage of him not being in the country
3 CONC . While ona walk with his noble knights Henry allegedly said, 'will no on
3 CONC e ridme of this turbulent priest?'(Henry II) Becket, again proved to be a
3 CONC burden to Henry. In response to Henry's remarks about Becket, fourknight
3 CONC s sought to find Becket back in Canterbury. The knights hadtaken Henry'
3 CONC s words literally and traveled to Canterbury with theintentions of killin
3 CONC g Becket, doing Henry a favor. Becket was openlyslain by the four knight
3 CONC s when he was kneeling at an evening prayer.Everyone's attention focuse
3 CONC d on Henry who was criticized for themurder. Henry was saddened and mourn
3 CONC ed when he learned of Becket'sdeath. Henry claimed to be heartbroken an
3 CONC d felt he neededforgiveness.(England during crusades) The knights pointe
3 CONC d the orderingof the   killing towards Henry as they tried to divert th
3 CONC e attention.Henry's words were taken literally by the knights and they ac
3 CONC ted upontheir own judgement.   Although evidence also pointed towards Hen
3 CONC ry, he was absolved of thecrime by Pope Alexander III in 1172. Not long a
3 CONC fter Henry took apilgrimage to the tomb of Thomas Becket in Canterbury. H
3 CONC e did this toshow his forgiveness to everyone and to clear his own inne
3 CONC r conflicts.After Henry's struggles to clear his guilt over Becket's deat
3 CONC h hebegan to fall apart. Henry's sons began to fight over who would behei
3 CONC r to the throne. Henry favored John to heir the throne althoughJohn and R
3 CONC ichard both rebelled to gain the respect they felt theydeserved. In the l
3 CONC ater years, it proved to be Phillip II of France whoproved to be the cunn
3 CONC ing opponent. Henry's last years were spenttrying to hold on to what he h
3 CONC ad proudly built up. At Henrys death hewas forced to name Richard the hei
3 CONC r to the throne, and Richard wasprobably the least liked son.(Hay 175) Th
3 CONC e conflict over theseparation of Church and State between Henry and Becke
3 CONC t kept Henry'spower over England in balance. Henry's ability to deal wit
3 CONC h thesituation showed his intelligence and power.  At Becket's death over
3 CONC the separation of Church and State proved that the monarch was theultimat
3 CONC e ruler over the land. King Henry II was burdened to his deathover a guil

1 NOTE Henry was the first of the Plantagenets, the name coming from thefact tha
2 CONC t he was fond of wearing a spring of the broom-plant in hishelmet. From E
2 CONC nclopedia Britannica Online, article titled Henry II: 'byname HENRY OF AN
2 CONC JOU, HENRY PLANTAGENET, HENRY FITZEMPRESS, OR HENRYCURTMANTLE (SHORT MANT
2 CONC LE) duke of Normandy (from 1150), count of Anjou(from 1151), duke of Aqui
2 CONC taine (from 1152), and king of England (from1154), who greatly expanded h
2 CONC is Anglo-French domains and strengthenedthe royal administration in Engla
2 CONC nd. His quarrels with Thomas Becket,archbishop of Canterbury, and with me
2 CONC mbers of his family (his wife,Eleanor of Aquitaine, and such sons as Rich
2 CONC ard the Lion-Heart and JohnLackland) ultimately brought about his defeat
2 CONC . 'Henry II lived in an age of biographers and letter writers of genius.J
2 CONC ohn of Salisbury, Thomas Becket, Giraldus Cambrensis, Walter Map,Peter o
2 CONC f Blois, and others knew him well and left their impressions.All agreed o
2 CONC n his outstanding ability and striking personality andalso recorded his e
2 CONC rrors and aspects of his character that appearcontradictory, whereas mode
2 CONC rn historians agree upon the difficulty ofreconciling its main features
2 CONC . Without deep religious or moralconviction, Henry nevertheless was respe
2 CONC cted by three contemporary saints, Aelred of Rievaulx, Gilbert ofSempring
2 CONC ham, and Hugh of Lincoln. Normally an approachable andfaithful friend an
2 CONC d master, he could behave with unreasonableinhumanity. His conduct and ai
2 CONC ms were always self-centred, but he wasneither a tyrant nor an odious ego
2 CONC ist. Both as man and ruler he lackedthe stamp of greatness that marked Al
2 CONC fred the Great and William theConqueror. He seemed also to lack wisdom an
2 CONC d serenity; and he had nocomprehensive view of the country's interest, n
2 CONC o ideals of kingship, no sympathetic care for hispeople. But if his reig
2 CONC n is to be judged by its consequences forEngland, it undoubtedly stands h
2 CONC igh in importance, and Henry, as itsmainspring, appears among the most no
2 CONC table of English kings.'   HenryII was Count of Anjou (1151-1189) whose f
2 CONC amily emblem was the'plantegenet', a yellow flowering broom; Duke of Norm
2 CONC andy (1151-1189);Duke of Aquitane (1152-1189) and as King of England (115
2 CONC 4-1189), ruledan empire that stretched from the Tweed to the Pyrenees.  H
2 CONC e was theFounder of the Angevin, or Plantagenet, line. Henry was the firs
2 CONC t offourteen hereditary kings, who were later referred to in the historyo
2 CONC racles as Plantagenets.  He is more commonly known as FitzEmpress,Henry I
2 CONC I Curtmantle, King of England.   In spite of frequent hostilities with th
2 CONC e French King, his ownfamily and rebellious Barons (culminating in the gr
2 CONC eat revolt of1173-74) and his quarrel with Thomas Becket, Henry II mainta
2 CONC inedcontrol over his possessions until shortly before his death.   Henr
2 CONC y II's judicial and administrative reforms, which increasedRoyal contro
2 CONC l and influence at the expense of the Barons, were ofgreat constitutiona
2 CONC l importance.  Henry II Introduced trial by Jury.   Henry II, by marryin
2 CONC g ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE immediately after herdivorce from Louis VII, Kin
2 CONC g of France, gained vast territories inFrance. Henry had lands reaching f
2 CONC or 1000 miles, and it was this vastdomain, which was called the Angevin E
2 CONC mpire.   In 1153 he invaded England and forced STEPHEN to acknowledge hi
2 CONC m ashis heir. As king he restored order to war-ravaged England, subduedth
2 CONC e barons, centralized the power of government in royalty, andstrengthene
2 CONC d royal courts. Henry's desire to increase royal authoritybrought him int
2 CONC o conflict with THOMAS áA BECKET, whom he had made(1162) archbishop of Ca
2 CONC nterbury. The quarrel, which focused largely onthe jurisdiction of the ch
2 CONC urch courts, came to a head when Henryissued (1163) the Constitutions o
2 CONC f CLARENDON, defining therelationship between church and state, and ende
2 CONC d (1170) with Becket'smurder, for which Henry was forced by public indign
2 CONC ation to dopenance. During his reign he gained northern counties from Sco
2 CONC tlandand increased his French holdings.   Henry II was also involved in f
2 CONC amily struggles. Encouraged by theirmother and LOUIS VI of France, his th
2 CONC ree oldest sons, Henry, RICHARDI, and Geoffrey, rebelled (1173-74) agains
2 CONC t him. The rebellioncollapsed, but at the time of Henry's death, Richar
2 CONC d and the youngestson, JOHN, were in the course of another rebellion.  H
2 CONC e wasunfortunate in love, relentlessly and romantically pursuing the hand
2 CONC of his wife, Eleanor, who became a selfish spoilt lady, and who turnedhe
2 CONC r sons against their own father. Because of the rebellion by theeldest so
2 CONC n, Henry was crushed, and Eleanor was placed under housearrest for fiftee
2 CONC n years. The other brothers placed continual pressureon their father, i
2 CONC n alliances with the King of France.  Henry died alonely and grief strick
2 CONC en man deserted by all of those he had lovedand honored. Contemporaries
2 CONC : Louis VII (King of France, 1137-1180), Thomas Beckett(Archbishop of Can
2 CONC terbury), Pope Adrian IV, Frederick I (FrederickBarbarossa, Holy Roman Em
2 CONC peror, 1152-1190) Henry II, first of the Angevin kings, was one of the mo
2 CONC st effective ofall England's monarchs. He came to the throne amid the ana
2 CONC rchy ofStephen's reign and promptly collared his errant barons. He refine
2 CONC dNorman government and created a capable, self-standing bureaucracy.His e
2 CONC nergy was equaled only by his ambition and intelligence. Henrysurvived wa
2 CONC rs, rebellion, and controversy to successfully rule one ofthe Middle Ages
2 CONC ' most powerful kingdoms. Henry was raised in the French province of Anjo
2 CONC u and first visitedEngland in 1142 to defend his mother's claim to the di
2 CONC sputed throne ofStephen. His continental possessions were already vast be
2 CONC fore hiscoronation: He acquired Normandy and Anjou upon the death of hisf
2 CONC ather in September 1151, and his French holdings more than doubledwith hi
2 CONC s marriage to Eleanor of Aquitane (ex-wife of King Louis VII ofFrance). I
2 CONC n accordance with the Treaty of Wallingford, a successionagreement signe
2 CONC d by Stephen and Matilda in 1153, Henry was crowned inOctober 1154. The c
2 CONC ontinental empire ruled by Henry and his sonsincluded the French countie
2 CONC s of Brittany, Maine, Poitou, Touraine,Gascony, Anjou, Aquitane, and Norm
2 CONC andy. Henry was technically a feudalvassal of the king of France but, i
2 CONC n reality, owned more territory andwas more powerful than his French lord
2 CONC . Although King John (Henry'sson) lost most of the English holdings in Fr
2 CONC ance, English kings laidclaim to the French throne until the fifteenth ce
2 CONC ntury. Henry alsoextended his territory in the British Isles in two signi
2 CONC ficant ways.First, he retrieved Cumbria and Northumbria form Malcom IV o
2 CONC f Scotlandand settled the Anglo-Scot border in the North. Secondly, altho
2 CONC ugh hissuccess with Welsh campaigns was limited, Henry invaded Ireland an
2 CONC dsecured an English presence on the island. English and Norman barons i
2 CONC n Stephen's reign manipulated feudal law toundermine royal authority; Hen
2 CONC ry instituted many reforms to weakentraditional feudal ties and strengthe
2 CONC n his position. Unauthorizedcastles built during the previous reign wer
2 CONC e razed. Monetary paymentsreplaced military service as the primary duty o
2 CONC f vassals. TheExchequer was revitalized to enforce accurate record keepin
2 CONC g and taxcollection. Incompetent sheriffs were replaced and the authorit
2 CONC y ofroyal courts was expanded. Henry empowered a new social class ofgover
2 CONC nment clerks that stabilized procedure - the government couldoperate effe
2 CONC ctively in the king's absence and would subsequently provesufficiently te
2 CONC nacious to survive the reign of incompetent kings.Henry's reforms allowe
2 CONC d the emergence of a body of common law toreplace the disparate customs o
2 CONC f feudal and county courts. Jury trialswere initiated to end the old Germ
2 CONC anic trials by ordeal or battle.Henry's systematic approach to law provid
2 CONC ed a common basis fordevelopment of royal institutions throughout the ent
2 CONC ire realm. The process of strengthening the royal courts, however, yielde
2 CONC d anunexpected controversy. The church courts instituted by William theCo
2 CONC nqueror became a safe haven for criminals of varying degree andability, f
2 CONC or one in fifty of the English population qualified asclerics. Henry wish
2 CONC ed to transfer sentencing in such cases to theroyal courts, as church cou
2 CONC rts merely demoted clerics to laymen.Thomas Beckett, Henry's close frien
2 CONC d and chancellor since 1155, wasnamed Archbishop of Canterbury in June 11
2 CONC 62 but distanced himself fromHenry and vehemently opposed the weakening o
2 CONC f church courts. Beckettfled England in 1164, but through the interventio
2 CONC n of Pope Adrian IV(the lone English pope), returned in 1170.  He greatl
2 CONC y angered Henryby opposing  the coronation of Prince Henry. Exasperated
2 CONC , Henryhastily and publicly conveyed his desire to be rid of the contenti
2 CONC ousArchbishop - four ambitious knights took the king at his word andmurde
2 CONC red Beckett in his own cathedral on December 29, 1170. Henryendured a rat
2 CONC her limited storm of protest over the incident and thecontroversy passed
2 CONC . Henry's plans of dividing his myriad lands and titles evoked treacheryf
2 CONC rom his sons. At the encouragement - and sometimes because of thetreatmen
2 CONC t - of their mother, they rebelled against their fatherseveral times, oft
2 CONC en with Louis VII of France as their accomplice. Thedeaths of Henry the Y
2 CONC oung King in 1183 and Geoffrey in 1186 gave norespite from his children'
2 CONC s rebellious nature; Richard, with theassistance of Philip II Augustus o
2 CONC f France, attacked and defeatedHenry on July 4, 1189 and forced him to ac
2 CONC cept a humiliating peace.Henry II died two days later, on July 6, 1189
2 CONC . A few quotes from historic manuscripts shed a unique light on Henry,Ele
2 CONC anor, and their sons. From Sir Winston Churchill Kt, 1675: 'Henry II Plan
2 CONC tagenet, the veryfirst of that name and race, and the very greatest Kin
2 CONC g that Englandever knew, but withal the most unfortunate . . . his deat
2 CONC h beingimputed to those only to whom himself had given life, his ungracio
2 CONC ussons. . .' From Sir Richard Baker, A Chronicle of the Kings of England:
2 CONC Concerning endowments of mind, he was of a spirit in the highestdegree ge
2 CONC nerous . . . His custom was to be always in action; for whichcause, if h
2 CONC e had no real wars, he would have feigned . . . To hischildren he was bot
2 CONC h indulgent and hard; for out of indulgence hecaused his son henry to b
2 CONC e crowned King in his own time; and out ofhardness he caused his younge
2 CONC r sons to rebel against him . . . Hemarried Eleanor, daughter of Willia
2 CONC m Duke of Guienne, late wife ofLewis the Seventh of France.

1 NOTE From Encyclopedia Britannica Online, article titled Eleanor ofAquitaine
2 CONC : 'also called ELEANOR OF GUYENNE, French âELâEONORE, OR ALIâENOR,D'AQUIT
2 CONC AINE, OR DEGUYENNE, queen consort of both Louis VII of France(in 1137-52
2 CONC ) and Henry II of England (in 1152-1204) and mother ofRichard I the Lion-
2 CONC Heart and John of England. She was perhaps the mostpowerful woman in 12th
2 CONC -century Europe. 'She died in 1204 at the monastery at Fontevrault, Anjou
2 CONC , where shehad retired after the  campaign at Mirebeau. Her contributio
2 CONC n toEngland extended beyond her own lifetime; after the  loss of Normandy
2 CONC (1204), it was her own ancestral lands and not the old Normanterritorie
2 CONC s that remained loyal to England. She has been misjudged bymany French hi
2 CONC storians who have noted only her youthful frivolity,ignoring the tenacity
2 CONC , political wisdom, and energy that characterizedthe years of her maturit
2 CONC y. 'She was beautiful and just, imposing andmodest, humble and elegant'
2 CONC ; and, as the nuns of Fontevrault wrote intheir necrology: a queen 'who s
2 CONC urpassed almost all the queens of theworld.'ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE (1122-12
2 CONC 04) was one of the most importantrulers of Medieval Europe. Many noblewom
2 CONC en in the Middle Ages were well-educated. but Eleanor hadthe chance to us
2 CONC e her education at a time when European politics wasdominated by men. Whe
2 CONC n she was just fifteen, Eleanor's father died, and she inheritedAquitaine
2 CONC . the largest kingdom in France. That same year she marriedKing Louis VI
2 CONC I and became Queen of France. Although still a teenager,Eleanor was an im
2 CONC pressive figure--beautiful, very well-educated, andfearlessly independent
2 CONC . When Louis went off on the Crusades, she went with him, travelingthousa
2 CONC nds of miles, much of it through hostile lands. But Eleanor and Louis ha
2 CONC d no male heir, and tensions developed betweenthem. The Pope granted the
2 CONC m a divorce when Eleanor was twenty-nine.Within months. Eleanor married H
2 CONC enry Plantagent, her ex-husband's mainrival. Two years later Henry becam
2 CONC e King of England--and Eleanor was aqueen again. However, Henry soon fel
2 CONC l in love with another woman, and Eleanor leftEngland to set up her own c
2 CONC ourt in Aquitaine, which she still ruled.Troubadours from all over Franc
2 CONC e flocked to her palace at Poitiers,where Eleanor acted as patron of th
2 CONC e arts. Many of the ideas ofchivalry that we associate with the Middle Ag
2 CONC es were developed inEleanor's court.. -----------------------------------
2 CONC -------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONC ------------------   Some say King Lewis carried her into the Holy Land
2 CONC , where shecarried herself not very holily, but led a licentious life; an
2 CONC d, whichis the worst kind of licentiousness, in carnal familiarity with a
2 CONC Turk.

1 NOTE From Encyclopedia Britannica Online, article titled 'Blanche ofCastile:
2 CONC ' 'French BLANCHE DE CASTILLE, Spanish BLANCA DE CASTILLA, wife of LouisV
2 CONC III of France, mother of Louis IX (St. Louis), and twice regent ofFranc
2 CONC e (1226-34, 1248-52), who by wars and marital alliances did muchto secur
2 CONC e and unify French territories.   Blanche was the daughter ofAlfonso VII
2 CONC I of Castile and Eleanor, who was the daughter of Henry IIof England. He
2 CONC r grandmother Eleanor of Aquitaine, queen of England, traveled to Spain t
2 CONC o take the 11-year-old Blanche to France,where a marriage treaty was conc
2 CONC luded with Louis, the young son ofKing Philip II Augustus. This political
2 CONC ly motivated marriage had beenarranged by Blanche's uncle, King John of E
2 CONC ngland, and was celebratedin 1200 at Portsmouth, Hampshire. It represente
2 CONC d only a brief truce inthe struggle between England and France for contro
2 CONC l over certainFrench territories. 'Blanche, who became French through mar
2 CONC riage, was gradually to becomeFrench in spirit as well. Although she di
2 CONC d not cease to be concernedfor her family, among them her uncle John an
2 CONC d his allies, herbrother-in-law Ferrand of Portugal, and her cousin Ott
2 CONC o of Brunswick(later Holy Roman emperor Otto IV), she rejoiced at the Fre
2 CONC nch victoryover Otto and the English at Bouvines in 1214, marking the fir
2 CONC st stageof French unification, a goal for which she was constantly to str
2 CONC ive.In the same year, she gave birth to Louis, the future king of France
2 CONC . Upon John of England'sdeath, Blanche boldly tried to seize the Englis
2 CONC h throne: in 1216 Louisof France invaded England on her behalf. The Engli
2 CONC sh stood firmagainst him, and John's nine-year-old son was finally crowne
2 CONC d HenryIII. 'A devout Roman Catholic, Blanche soon became involved in wha
2 CONC t shesincerely believed to be a holy war against the heretical Cathari, a
2 CONC sect founded on the belief that good and evil had two separatecreators, w
2 CONC hich was flourishing throughout southern France. Herhusband, who became L
2 CONC ouis VIII in 1223, took part in a crusade againstthe Cathari but suffere
2 CONC d a fatal attack of dysentery upon returning tothe north of France in 122
2 CONC 6. In accordance with her husband's will,Blanche became both guardian o
2 CONC f the 12-year-old Louis and regent ofFrance. She zealously pressed to hav
2 CONC e Louis crowned immediately, andthe coronation took place at Reims thre
2 CONC e weeks after Louis VIII'sdeath. 'Her most pressing problem was to deal w
2 CONC ith a rebellion of the greatbarons, organized by Philip Hurepel, the ille
2 CONC gitimate son of KingPhilip II Augustus, and supported by King Henry III o
2 CONC f England. In theface of such adversity, Blanche showed herself by turn
2 CONC s a delicatediplomat, a clever negotiator, and a strong leader. Dressed i
2 CONC n white,on a white palfrey draped in the same colour, she rode into battl
2 CONC e atthe head of her troops. After an attempted abduction of the youngking
2 CONC , Blanche did not hesitate to replace rebel noble associates with commone
2 CONC rs if she thought itnecessary. She also created local militias. Blanche w
2 CONC as gradually ableto subdue the revolt, establish a new truce with England
2 CONC , and, in1229, pacify the south of France by signing the Treaty of Pari
2 CONC s withRaymond VII, count of Toulouse. France then entered an era of domes
2 CONC ticstability, which saw the construction of many cathedrals throughoutth
2 CONC e country. 'On only one occasion did Blanche fail to exhibit diplomatic c
2 CONC onduct.In 1229 a dispute between an innkeeper and some students took plac
2 CONC e inthe Latin Quarter in Paris. The police were summoned, and the student
2 CONC swere beaten and thrown into the Seine; such intervention in the LatinQua
2 CONC rter, however, was contrary to the prerogatives granted to theuniversity
2 CONC , and the faculty and students threatened to strike if theuniversity's pr
2 CONC ivileges were not respected. Badly advised, Blancheheld firm, but the uni
2 CONC versity closed its doors, and the faculty andstudents left Paris for th
2 CONC e provinces and abroad. It was to take fouryears and the intervention o
2 CONC f the pope before the university wouldreturn to Paris with new prerogativ
2 CONC es, this time granted by Blancheherself. 'Although Louis IX came of age o
2 CONC n April 25, 1236, Blanche remained athis side as his most loyal and stead
2 CONC fast supporter. She lacked tact,however, with regard to her son's privat
2 CONC e life. Although Blancheherself had selected Margaret of Provence to be L
2 CONC ouis's wife, shetreated Margaret with considerable severity. In 1244, aft
2 CONC er Louisrecovered from a serious illness, he and his wife, much againstBl
2 CONC anche's wishes, made a vow to go on a crusade against the Muslims.They em
2 CONC barked in 1248, and once again the kingdom was entrusted toBlanche. Infor
2 CONC med of Louis's defeat at Al-Mansurah, Egypt, and hissubsequent imprisonme
2 CONC nt, Blanche herself went to seek his ransom andthat of the French army. S
2 CONC he petitioned her parents, her allies, andthe pope for funds and supplies
2 CONC , but interest in the crusade haddwindled. 'Although weakened by a hear
2 CONC t ailment, Blanche did not neglect herobligations as a regent. Continuin
2 CONC g to preside over council meetings,she signed laws and watched over the p
2 CONC oor of Paris. When some of thepoor were mistreated by the cathedral chapt
2 CONC er, she herself rode, asformerly, to open the gates to their prison. On h
2 CONC er way to the Abbeyof the Lys, one of her favourite retreats, Blanche suf
2 CONC fered an attackof the heart ailment that was to take her life. She was re
2 CONC turned tothe palace of the Louvre, dressed in a nun's habit, and laid o
2 CONC n a bedof hay. There, after begging forgiveness of all and having receive
2 CONC dthe last sacraments, she died. She was buried at Maubuisson Abbey andhe
2 CONC r heart taken to the Abbey of the Lys. Louis IX was in Jaffa when helearn
2 CONC ed of his mother's death. The news distressed him greatly, for hewas awar
2 CONC e that he had lost not only an incomparable parent but alsothe stronges
2 CONC t supporter of his kingship.'

2 CONC 's death (1126) did his stepfatherfinally relinquish his claims. Alfons
2 CONC o was then formally accepted asemperor by the kings of Aragon and Pamplon

2 CONC ers. His capture ofAlmerâia (1147) from the Moors won him renown, as di

2 TYPE Anecdote
2 NOTE The story of the Norman Conquest resembles a soap opera, pitting the wily
3 CONC , deceitful villain (Dermot MacMurrough) against the well meaning but hap
3 CONC less incompetent (Tiernan O'Rourke). MacMurrough and O'Rourke were morta
3 CONC l enemies. The antagonism between them dated to 1152, when O'Rourke had b
3 CONC een humiliated by MacMurrough's abduction of O'Rourke's wife, Dervorgilla
3 CONC . But MacMurrough may not have been as culpable as it seemed. According t
3 CONC o Irish folklore, it was Dervorgilla herself, then aged 44, who arrange
3 CONC d the abduction, with MacMurrough, then aged 42, simply going along. Neve
3 CONC rtheless, MacMurrough was hardly an innocent bystander, having eagerly ac
3 CONC cepted the invitation, and having staged a lifelike abduction, with horse
3 CONC men, screaming victim, and all the trappings. O'Rourke recovered Dervorgi
3 CONC lla the following year (1153), but he never got the revenge he wanted. 
3 CONT The subsequent hostilities between O'Rourke and MacMurrough were playe
3 CONC d out in the context of a larger battle between Rory O'Connor and Murtaug
3 CONC h MacLochlain for the high kingship of Ireland. O'Rourke was allied wit
3 CONC h O'Connor, the eventual winner, while MacMurrough supported, and more im
3 CONC portantly was protected by, MacLochlain. 
3 CONT In 1166, finally, after a 10 year war, O'Connor defeated MacLochlain onc
3 CONC e and for all. O'Connor was magnanimous in victory. He reduced MacLochlai
3 CONC n's petit-kingdom to a small area, and took hostages, but otherwise permi
3 CONC tted him to live out his reign. 
3 CONT O'Rourke had no intention of extending similar generosity to MacMurrough
3 CONC . He got his revenge later that same year when MacLochlain (MacMurrough'
3 CONC s long time protector) died, and O'Rourke, along with several cohorts, fo
3 CONC rced MacMurrough to flee Ireland. 
3 CONT But MacMurrough quickly regrouped. He sought help from Henry II, the afo
3 CONC rementioned Norman ruler of the Angevin empire. To Henry, MacMurrough rep
3 CONC resented opportunity knocking. Henry had no enthusiasm for personally lea
3 CONC ding an expedition to Ireland -- after all, he had previously declined t
3 CONC o do so, even after seeking and receiving the Bull Laudabiliter  but h
3 CONC e had nothing to lose by encouraging MacMurrough. Thus Henry issued an op
3 CONC en letter to his subjects, authorizing them to render military assistanc
3 CONC e to MacMurrough. 
3 CONT MacMurrough then contacted one of the great Norman leaders in Wales, th
3 CONC e legendary "Strongbow" (a.k.a. Richard FitzGilbert de Clare, the earl o
3 CONC f Strigoil). Initially, Strongbow was reluctant, but then MacMurrough off
3 CONC ered Strongbow his eldest daughter, Aoife (Eva), in marriage, together wi
3 CONC th the right to succeed MacMurrough as king of Leinster. Finally, Strongb
3 CONC ow agreed to lead an army into Ireland to restore MacMurrough to power. 
3 CONT With Strongbow on his side, MacMurrough then was also able to recrui
3 CONC t a number of Norman and Flemish knights whose names now are common in Ir
3 CONC eland: FitzHenry, Carew, FitzGerald, Barry, Prendergast, Fleming, Roche
3 CONC , Cheevers, Synott. 
3 CONT The impatient MacMurrough returned to Ireland with a handful of Norman
3 CONC s in 1167, but O'Connor and O'Rourke soon forced him to submit. Always th
3 CONC e master of deceit, MacMurrough even paid O'Rourke one hundred ounces o
3 CONC f gold as reparation for abducting Dervorgilla. But MacMurrough was not d
3 CONC iscouraged. He knew that help was on the way. 
3 CONT The first Norman troop ships, about 600 in number, landed at Bannow Ba
3 CONC y early in May 1169. MacMurrough and several hundred of his men promptl
3 CONC y joined the Normans, and together they marched on Wexford. The Viking in
3 CONC habitants directly confronted the invaders, expecting to find a rag-tag o
3 CONC utfit of enthusiastic but poorly armed Irishmen. Instead they discovere
3 CONC d a fully armed and disciplined professional army, ready for the kill. Th
3 CONC e Vikings were driven back into Wexford, and next day the town was force
3 CONC d to surrender. 
3 CONT Strongbow himself now set sail for Ireland. His advance guard, ten knigh
3 CONC ts and seventy archers, was led by a magnificent young soldier-warrior fr
3 CONC om the FitzGerald family, Raymond Carew, commonly called 'le Gros' ('th
3 CONC e Fat'). Le Gros landed north of Waterford and quickly built earthen ramp
3 CONC arts which remain even today. Almost immediately, an opposition army -- s
3 CONC everal thousand Vikings and Gaelic-Irish from Waterford and the surroundi
3 CONC ng areas -- attacked le Gros and his contingent of eighty Norman and Flem
3 CONC ing soldiers. 
3 CONT Incredibly, le Gros and his vastly outnumbered troops prevailed. Behin
3 CONC d the ramparts, le Gros had concealed a herd of cattle, which he suddenl
3 CONC y stampeded into the oncoming troops, trampling the front rank of the att
3 CONC ackers. In all the confusion, le Gros and his force routed the remainin
3 CONC g natives, seventy of whom were captured alive. As a message to Waterford
3 CONC , the prisoners' limbs were broken, their heads severed, and their bodie
3 CONC s thrown over the cliffs. 
3 CONT Now Strongbow and his army of about two hundred knights and a thousand o
3 CONC ther troops joined le Gros, and two days later, they attacked Waterford
3 CONC . Twice the Normans were beaten off, but eventually le Gros breached th
3 CONC e walls at a weak point, and captured Waterford. 
3 CONT Now MacMurrough's daughter, Aoife, came to Waterford, where she marrie
3 CONC d Strongbow. A celebrated fresco in the British House of Commons depict
3 CONC s the wedding ceremony occurring at the close of the battle, against a ba
3 CONC ckground of burning buildings and dead Irishmen. The fresco is a classi
3 CONC c example of artistic license, since Aoife did not arrive until several d
3 CONC ays after the battle. But the artist captured brilliantly the essential e
3 CONC lements of the pact which MacMurrough had made with Strongbow two years e
3 CONC arlier in Wales. 
3 CONT Strongbow and MacMurrough now set their sights on taking Dublin, which w
3 CONC as a semi-independent Viking kingdom. With the wily MacMurrough leading t
3 CONC he way, the Normans evaded an ambush laid by O'Connor and O'Rourke and ar
3 CONC rived unscathed at the city walls. The Vikings were inclined to surrender
3 CONC , but while negotiations were still ongoing, le Gros and Milo de Cogan le
3 CONC d their troops through a breach in the city walls and routed the city's i
3 CONC neffectual defenders. Asgall, the Viking-Irish King of Dublin, managed t
3 CONC o escape with some of his Viking followers. As they sailed away, Asgall v
3 CONC owed to return and retake Dublin. 
3 CONT MacMurrough became deathly ill in April 1171, and while Strongbow was vi
3 CONC siting him, Asgall, who had been forced to flee only nine months earlier
3 CONC , made good on his vow to return. He brought with him a fleet of ships ca
3 CONC rrying about a thousand Vikings, who mounted a fierce assault on Strongbo
3 CONC w's Dublin. But even without Strongbow to lead them, the Normans prevaile
3 CONC d. Asgall, who was taken prisoner, was tried, convicted and beheaded in t
3 CONC he hall of what formerly had been his own palace in Dublin.

2 CONC ug.thompson/BraoseWeb/index1.htm: 'Reginald supported Giles in his rebell
2 CONC ions against King John. Theywere both active against the King in the baro
2 CONC ns' war.  Neither waspresent at the signing of Magna Carta because they w
2 CONC ere still rebelswho refused to compromise. K. John aquiesced to Reginald'
2 CONC s claims tothe de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. He became Lord o
2 CONC f Brecon,Abergavenny, Builth and other Marcher Lordships but was very muc
2 CONC h avassal of Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd and now his father-in-law.H
2 CONC enry III restored Reginald to favour and the Bramber estates(confiscate
2 CONC d from William by K. John) in 1217. At thisseemingbetrayal, Rhys and Owai
2 CONC n, Reginald's nephews who were princesof Deheubarth, were incensed and th
2 CONC ey took Builth (except the castle). Llewelyn Fawr also becameangry and be
2 CONC seiged Brecon.    Reginald eventually surrendered toLlewelyn and gave u
2 CONC p Seinenydd (Swansea). By 1221 they were at waragain with Llewelyn layin
2 CONC g seige to Builth.  The seige was relieved byHenry III's forces. From thi
2 CONC s time on Llewelyn tended to support theclaims of Reginald's nephew Joh
2 CONC n concerning the de Braose lands.Reginald was a witness to the re-issue o

1 NOTE LADY GODIVA (Godgifu, in the spelling of her time.)
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT ------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 CONC --------
2 CONT 
2 CONT 
2 CONT An Anglo-Saxon gentlewoman, patron of the arts, equestrienne, and tax pr
2 CONC otester, etc. All the historians say that she "flourished, circa 1040 - 1
2 CONC 080 A.D." 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Leofric, earl of Mercia, and husband of Lady Godiva, was a man of broa
2 CONC d but obscure interests; a religious man thoroughly Christian, and an ent
2 CONC repreneur, raconteur, and general all around good sport. At the same time
2 CONC , he did have an avaricious streak in him, and it is for this reason tha
2 CONC t his name has survived through the ages, but more prominently for his in
2 CONC teresting response to the nagging of his bleeding-heart wife, who pestere
2 CONC d him incessantly over details of the daily lives of the peasants under h
2 CONC is control, and similar fussy matters.
2 CONT 
2 CONT It's not that she was always being petulant about everything he did, bu
2 CONC t certain of his actions caused her to be irritable, but that part of th
2 CONC e story comes later.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Actually both Leofric and Godiva were quite religious, and upon their mo
2 CONC ve to Coventry, Warwickshire, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire (where Leofri
2 CONC c had earned his fortune and title from amazing successes in the mutton t
2 CONC rade), they were immediately impressed by the lack of proper facilities f
2 CONC or training and housing men of the cloth in or around the raucous littl
2 CONC e district of Coventry (pop. 6215). How, they thought, were the spiritua
2 CONC l needs of these simple souls to be cared for? At the same time, being so
2 CONC mewhat "nouveau riche" and anxious to make their mark in what passed fo
2 CONC r genteel society there (not having had the proper credentials to enter s
2 CONC uch circles back in Shropshire -- which may have been a big piece of th
2 CONC e motivation for the move), they decided to apply some of their ready cas
2 CONC h to a worthy public cause.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Near the physical center of Coventry, where the bombed-out ruin of might
2 CONC y Coventry Cathedral stands today, Leofric and Godiva (in 1043) founded a
2 CONC nd funded an abbey (some accounts say monastery), named in honor of Ste
2 CONC . Eunice of Saxmundham (an early martyr, slain by flaying at the hands o
2 CONC f the Romans). The abbey faced the rising sun, as was decreed it should b
2 CONC y Leofric in a moment of romantic inspiration. A simple affair, made of w
2 CONC attle and daub with a roof of thatched reeds in the manner of the day, i
2 CONC t was nevertheless imposing by standards in the village otherwise; it wa
2 CONC s the biggest structure in the entire region.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Before long this edifice was something of a social focus for the town, f
2 CONC unctioning not only as a center for the education and housing of those wh
2 CONC o had received the calling, but also as a gathering point where more vulg
2 CONC ar popular events and festivities could be celebrated. Leofric and Godiv
2 CONC a came to be awarded the attention and respect they longed for from the s
2 CONC tart, and they had served the purposes of the church as well. They did no
2 CONC t seem to mind that much of the activity circulating around the abbey wa
2 CONC s decidedly Druid in origin; at least the peasants were occupied and happ
2 CONC y. Coventry grew around the abbey. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT As a gentleman, and now established philanthropist of some local repute
2 CONC , Leofric assumed a growing role in the governance of public affairs, an
2 CONC d was given responsibility for certain financial matters (the town had gr
2 CONC own enough to actually have financial matters), which he quickly understo
2 CONC od as presenting especially interesting opportunities. One public work ge
2 CONC nerated the idea of another, if only some money were at hand to facilitat
2 CONC e such growth...
2 CONT 
2 CONT Meanwhile, Godiva's proficiency as a horsewoman had become polished t
2 CONC o a considerable degree, as she had acquired a taste for the hunt and th
2 CONC e social pleasantries which accrue to the activity "apres." Plus, the peo
2 CONC ple she met during these excursions which provided such complacency, wer
2 CONC e of a disposition and delicacy of interest to which she had aspired fo
2 CONC r some time. She could do worse than to engage in certain preoccupation
2 CONC s of the intellect, and considerations of the aesthetic, and so she immer
2 CONC sed herself in the arts and, therefore, society. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Perhaps, she earnestly thought, aid to those industrious in this field o
2 CONC f elevated concern (artists) would inspire the rude masses by means of ex
2 CONC ample. Commissioning a proper portrait of herself would be a good place t
2 CONC o start; it would be an inspiration for simpler souls, so the work was be
2 CONC gun.
2 CONT 
2 CONT It only slowly entered Godiva's consciousness that the lack of success s
2 CONC he was having in interesting the base masses in artistic concerns, beauti
2 CONC ful pictures of herself spread around or not, was rooted in the fact tha
2 CONC t nearly all of them spent 100% of their waking hours in partially effect
2 CONC ive efforts to feed and clothe themselves, and to provide some form of sh
2 CONC elter from the elements. Most were having a hard time of it, in light o
2 CONC f the fact that Leofric, in his new-found megalomaniacal grand-public-wor
2 CONC ks mode, had been taxing everything he could think of, even including a l
2 CONC evy on manure.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Lady Godiva would not have such noble aspirations -- such as art for eve
2 CONC ryone -- placed on a back burner for the sake of boring considerations li
2 CONC ke a municipal water supply. Men had such ignoble visions, always functio
2 CONC nal and mechanical, mostly never above waist level. This would not do, th
2 CONC e taxes must be reduced if this early medieval subsistence-agriculture vi
2 CONC llage was going to pull itself up into the 11th century and its more cult
2 CONC ured concerns. She went to have a pointed talk with Leofric.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Beside himself with raucous laughter, Leofric injured his left wrist sli
2 CONC ghtly as he fell off his stool in the hall of the village burghers, and t
2 CONC his sobered him up rather quickly. Reduce taxes in order to foster the pe
2 CONC asants' appreciation of silly pictures? Was she mad? No waterworks? Ther
2 CONC e would be no tax reduction; as a matter of fact, Leofric added a new ta
2 CONC x on pictures, which only had to be paid by his wife since she was the on
2 CONC ly person who had any, except for the church which was exempt.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Their argument became a classic war of wills, taking the equally classi
2 CONC c form of nagging versus stone-walling. However, at very long last, sinc
2 CONC e his wife would not give up and was driving him to distraction and worse
2 CONC , Leofric capitulated, but, regarding it all as something of a sport, att
2 CONC ached an interesting condition to his offer to allow some reduction in ta
2 CONC xation.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The ancient Greeks, he pointed out, and those coarser Romans as well, vi
2 CONC ewed the nude human body as one of the highest expressions of the perfect
2 CONC ion of Nature. Nudity was not seen as erotic in any sense, but as purity
2 CONC , and a celebration of the wonderful form of a sensuous being displayed i
2 CONC n all its marvelous glory for the betterment and appreciation of those en
2 CONC lightened enough to consider this aesthetic. To present a well formed nud
2 CONC e body as an object of great beauty, even art, would be to offer a lesso
2 CONC n of inestimable value to the simple peasants of Coventry, whose experien
2 CONC ces and perceptions had never been enlightened to appreciate such perfect
2 CONC ion.
2 CONT 
2 CONT If Lady Godiva truly believed in the crusade she was promoting, then sh
2 CONC e should lead it herself, and offer to the citizens of Coventry an exampl
2 CONC e of the glorious beauty to be understood by careful consideration of a p
2 CONC erfect nude human body. There could be no shame in this, it would be th
2 CONC e most gross error to consider it as such. Was she ashamed of the wonder
2 CONC s of God's work? Besides, with all that horse-back riding, and similar, s
2 CONC he had lost some weight and looked pretty good.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Therefore, Leofric proclaimed that if Lady Godiva would ride her horse t
2 CONC hrough the crowded market-place of Coventry, in the full light of mid-day
2 CONC , clothed in only that which God had given her, as an example of the perf
2 CONC ection of God's work and as an expression of the highest possible aesthet
2 CONC ic -- she had been spreading pictures of herself around anyway -- then h
2 CONC e would reduce taxes on the populace, lifting from them the burden Godiv
2 CONC a perceived, and erasing from himself any further doubt he might harbor o
2 CONC f the sincerity of Godiva's convictions.
2 CONT 
2 CONT To Leofric's absolute surprise, she agreed, once she had ensured that sh
2 CONC e actually had his "permission" to do so.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Taken aback by his wife's courage and certainty in her purposes Leofric
2 CONC , somewhat overwhelmed, then stated that he fully accepted the truth of L
2 CONC ady Godiva's belief in the merits of her cause, and so in response, on co
2 CONC mpletion of her ride he would not just reduce taxes, but would remove al
2 CONC l of them -- save those tolls on horses which were already in place befor
2 CONC e he assumed his office, and which were necessary for basic needs of th
2 CONC e city.
2 CONT 
2 CONT A day was chosen for the event, and while no particular effort had bee
2 CONC n expended to publicize the ride, talk of it had spread in whispers throu
2 CONC ghout the whole of Coventry. Not wishing to reveal that this concealed di
2 CONC scussion had taken place, and since people were curious about all aspect
2 CONC s of the affair and did not want to interrupt it, the marketplace's busin
2 CONC ess proceeded as it might have done on any other less interesting Thursda
2 CONC y in late August. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT As noon approached, so did Lady Godiva. She was not alone, but was accom
2 CONC panied by two female aides also on horseback, but normally clothed; one r
2 CONC ode on each side and slightly to the rear. Three horses walking on the co
2 CONC bbles in formation at a measured gait did not have the sound of the usua
2 CONC l traffic and bustle, and so -- since all were secretly and eagerly antic
2 CONC ipating the event -- her appearance was announced clearly to everyone.
2 CONT 
2 CONT She sat straight and properly in the saddle with a look of composure o
2 CONC n her face; relaxed, confident, unashamed. Her hair was done in two larg
2 CONC e braids which were curled snugly at the back of her head, one on each si
2 CONC de; she wore no jewelry or other adornment. People looked at her and sa
2 CONC w that she was not merely naked, or nude; rather she was in a higher stat
2 CONC e of presentation -- being a correct and elevated quality of her composur
2 CONC e, and resulting also from the people's appraisal, appreciation, and cons
2 CONC ideration beyond simple voyeurism.
2 CONT 
2 CONT To all present this was an experience like no other in their lives. Th
2 CONC e only images of people unclothed they had ever seen were in the church
2 CONC : Adam and Eve, and the crucified Christ. This was a lady, simple and nor
2 CONC mal with a body like that of every other woman present, a human, a creatu
2 CONC re of God's earth. Though he half meant it as a joke, Leofric's words ran
2 CONC g true: here was a celebration of being in its perfection. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Perhaps, as well, some believed with Zoroaster that sex is the bounty o
2 CONC f God.
2 CONT 
2 CONT So, all survived the event with peacefulness and dignity, and the taxe
2 CONC s were removed.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In the CHRONICA, written by Roger of Wendover (who died in 1236), the ac
2 CONC count of the year 1057 tells the story of Godiva's ride in full detail, a
2 CONC nd is the earliest surviving written description.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Even more complete versions are provided by the famous historian Ranul
2 CONC f Higden (died in 1364) in his POLYCHRONICON, and by Henry Knighton (die
2 CONC d c. 1396) who followed him, which explain not only the details of the ri
2 CONC de and its reasons, but also the specifics of the removed taxes, in parti
2 CONC cular that all save those on horses were eliminated.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Much later, King Edward I, being an inquisitive man (he devised an earne
2 CONC st, but rather awkward system for the classification of songbirds in Wale
2 CONC s), wished to discover the truth of the Godiva story and, therefore, comm
2 CONC issioned an inquiry of ancient records which showed that in 1057 and ther
2 CONC eabouts, there were indeed no taxes levied in Coventry except those on ho
2 CONC rses, which was a rather anomalous situation not seen elsewhere at the ti
2 CONC me, thereby establishing the merit and probable accuracy of the legend.
2 CONT 
2 CONT The tale of "Peeping Tom", who was struck blind (or dead) when he alon
2 CONC e gazed upon Lady Godiva was not added until the 17th century. This is al
2 CONC so true of the detail of the story, often added, that Godiva was covere
2 CONC d totally, except for her legs, by an enormous and improbable quantity o
2 CONC f hair. 
2 CONT 
2 CONT Doubtless both of these embellishments were supplied later by prudish Ch
2 CONC ristian churchmen who entirely missed the point and considered that viewi
2 CONC ng the unclothed human body under any circumstance was a heinous act whic
2 CONC h would damn one to eternal hell fire; they certainly thought the femal
2 CONC e body to be dirty and inferior to appreciation, and only worthy of bein
2 CONC g hidden from view. On the face of it such a view would seem to be a perv
2 CONC ersion, and affront to the beauty of God's work. The Greeks felt that th
2 CONC e idealized human form was the only one worthy to represent the gods on e
2 CONC arth. On the other hand, the Christian faith is unique in that it alone h
2 CONC as, throughout its history, suppressed any celebration of the beauty of t
2 CONC he human body.
2 CONT 
2 CONT So, what was Lady Godiva? A visionary; a social climber; a patron of th
2 CONC e arts; a dilettante of the worst order?
2 CONT 
2 CONT In any estimation, she had the guts to follow her convictions, and may h
2 CONC ave brought a degree of enlightenment to a small corner of 11th century E
2 CONC ngland. And, probably, no one went to Hell because of it.
